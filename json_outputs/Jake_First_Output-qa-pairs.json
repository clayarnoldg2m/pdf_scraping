This will be used to understand the threshold for your reported risks\nand opportunities in 3.1 and 3.6.\n\u2022 What constitutes a substantive effect will vary between organizations. You are\ntherefore asked to determine \u2018substantive\u2019 in the way that you would do for your\nbusiness decision-making. For example, a 1% reduction in profits will have different\neffects on different organizations depending on its respective profit margins. A\nsubstantive effect of relatively high magnitude could occur because of a large impact\non one of the following aspects, or because of a small number for all three combines\nto create a larger effect:\no the proportion of business units affected;\no the size of the effect on those business units;\no the dependency of the organization on that unit; and/or\no the potential for shareholder or customer concern.\n\u2022 Use the \u201cAdd row\u201d function if you define a substantive effect on your organization with\nrespect to risks or opportunities in more than one way. For example, if you use\nmultiple indicators or have different definitions for different parts of the business.\nMetrics considered in definition (column 7)\n\u2022 This column seeks to capture the different factors taken into account when defining a\nsubstantive effect on your organization with respect to risks and opportunities.\n\u2022 If you have provided a quantitative definition, these metrics could give further context\nto your quantitative indicator. For example, you may define risks to be substantive if\nthey could lead to a 10% decrease in revenue over your short-term time horizon (as\ndefined in 2.1). In this case, select \u201cTime horizon over which the effect occurs\u201d and\nprovide further details in column 8 \u201cApplication of definition\u201d.\n\u2022 If you are only providing a qualitative definition, select all relevant metrics used to\ndefine a substantive effect, or use \u201cOther, please specify\u201d to specify a different metric.\nApplication of definition (column 8)\n\u2022 Describe the thresholds considered to be substantive for the metrics reported in\ncolumn 7 \u201cMetrics considered in definition\u201d. For example:\no Frequency of effect occurring: i.e. once, quarterly, every two years etc.\no Time horizon over which the effect occurs: i.e., short-, medium-, and long-\nterm in line with your time horizons reported in 2.1.\no Likelihood of effect occurring: i.e., the percentage chance the effect will occur\n\u2022 Often, multiple metrics are used together as part of a matrix approach. If using a\nmatrix approach, describe how the metrics selected in column 7 \u201cMetrics considered\nin definition\u201d are used in combination and their respective weightings.\n\u2022 Describe how often the metrics, and their thresholds, are selected, reviewed, and\nupdated.\nPage 92 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net\n\nAuthoring notes\nTags\nCorporate authority Capital Markets\nEnvironmental Issue Question level CC, F, W, B, P\n(Theme)\nSector Question level All (+M-B)\nPollutant management procedures (W only)",

liabilities), financial performance (e.g., revenue or expenditure) and cash flows,\nirrespective of whether the risk has been responded to or accepted.\n\u2022 If a risk relates to multiple

See the\nExplanation of terms for more information on the types of risks.\nValue chain stage where the risk occurs (column 5)\n\u2022 Note for financial services companies: The options shown will be driven by the\norganizational activities you selected in 1.10.\n\u2022 Refer to the \u201cExplanation of Terms\u201d section for definitions of value chain stages.\nRisk type mapped to traditional financial services industry risk classification [FS only] (column\n6)\n\u2022 When assessing environmental risks in this column, consider their alignment with your\nexisting organizational framework. Determine how these risks integrate into your traditional\nindustry risk framework, particularly regarding the classification of potential financial effect.\nIf an identified risk corresponds to multiple industry risk categories, select all that apply.\no Capital adequacy and risks weighted assets: refers to the minimum amount\nof capital that must be held by financial institutions in order to reduce the risk of\ninsolvency.\no Liquidity risk: occurs when a financial institution cannot meet its short-term\ndebt obligations.\no Funding risk: refers to the risk associated with the effect on a project's cash\nflow from higher funding costs or lack of availability of funds.\no Market risk: refers to the possibility of loss resulting from an adverse\nmovement in asset prices.\no Credit risk: refers the possibility of a loss resulting from a counterparty\u2019s failure\nto repay a loan or meet contractual obligations.\no Insurance risk: refers to the possibility of loss resulting from an event(s) that\ntriggers the insurer to pay claims.\no Reputational risk: refers to the risk for negative public perception or to the\npotential of uncontrollable events to have an effect on a company's reputation.\no Policy and legal risk: refers to the possibility that legal action will be taken\nbecause of an individual's or corporation's actions, inaction, products, services,\nor other events.\no Systemic risk: the possibility that an event at the company level could trigger\nsevere instability or collapse an entire industry or economy.\no Operational risk: refers to the possibility of loss resulting from failed\nprocesses, systems, human error or outside influences.\nOrganization-specific description of risk (column 10)\n\u2022 Provide further contextual information on the risk driver, including more detail on the exact\nnature, location and/or regulation of the effect concerned, as well as any notable\ngeographic/regional examples.\n\u2022 Include organization-specific details, such as references to activities, programs, products,\nservices, methodologies, or operating locations specific to your organization\u2019s business or\noperations.\n% of portfolio value vulnerable to this risk [FS only] (column 12)\n\u2022 Provide the proportion of your total portfolio value based on total assets value (as reported\nin 1.10) that is vulnerable to this risk. See \u201cExplanation of terms\u201d for a definition of\nvulnerability.\nMagnitude (column 15)\n\u2022 The magnitude describes the extent to which the effect, if it occurred, would affect your\nbusiness. You should consider the business as a whole and therefore the magnitude can\nreflect both the damage that may be caused and the exposure to that potential damage.\nPage 123 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net\n\n\u2022 For example, two organizations may have identical facilities located on a coast in an area\nwhich is vulnerable to sea level rise. However, if organization A relies on that facility for\n90% of its production capacity and organization B relies on it for only 40% of its production\ncapacity, the magnitude of a sea level rise effect on organization A will be comparatively\nhigher than that on company B.\n\u2022 It is not possible for CDP to accurately define terms for magnitude as they will vary from\norganization to organization. For example, a 1% reduction in profits will have different\neffects on different organizations depending on the profit margins on which they work.\nTherefore, organizations are asked to determine magnitude on a qualitative scale. Factors\nto consider include:\no The proportion of business units affected;\no The size of the effect on those business units;\no The dependency of the company on those units; and\no The potential for shareholder or customer concern.\n\u2022 If the financial effect has not been assessed by your organization, select \u201cUnknown\u201d.\nEffect/Anticipated effect of the risk on the financial position, financial performance and cash\nflows of the organization in the [reporting year/selected future time horizons] (columns 16 & 17)\n\u2022 These columns appear dependent on selections in column 13 \u201cTime horizon over which\u2026\u201d.\n\u2022 If a quantitative figure cannot be provided, explain why the figure cannot be provided and describe\nthe financial effect in relative terms (e.g., as a percentage relative to a stated or publicly available\nfigure) or provide a qualitative estimate. Otherwise, if you are unable to provide any information\nto quantify the effect, state \u201cThe effect has not been quantified financially\u201d.\n\u2022 Examples of reasons for being unable to provide a quantitative figure include: \u201cthe\neffects are not separately identifiable\u201d or \u201cthe level of measurement uncertainty is too\nhigh, rendering quantitative information about this risk not useful\u201d.\n\u2022 In the latter case, this column should also be used to provide a description of the\nfinancial effect in relative terms (for example as a percentage relative to a stated or\npublicly available figure) or give a qualitative estimate of the financial effect.\nOtherwise, if you have no information about the financial effect, please state \u201cThe\neffect has not been quantified financially\u201d.

Therefore, only those three facilities should\nbe reported.\n\u2022 The environmental risks reported should be those which have had or are anticipated\nto have a substantive effect when considering the inherent risk (existing in the\nabsence of controls, i.e. not considering any mitigation or management measures that\nhave been or could be implemented) as well as the residual risk (remaining after a\nspecific action has been taken to manage the risk).\n\u2022 If facilities are exposed to water-related risks in a basin covering multiple\ncountries/areas, add a new row for each country/area and disclose the number of\nfacilities located there.\n\u2022 Oil & gas sector only: Provide data on the organization\u2019s production volume\nassociated with these facilities.\n\u2022 Electric utilities sector only: Provide data on the organization\u2019s annual electricity\ngeneration associated with these facilities.\nRiver basin (column 1b)\n\u2022 Select the relevant river basin from the drop-down options or select \u201cOther, please\nspecify\u201d if applicable.\n\u2022 For organizations withdrawing water from large confined aquifers that may not\ndischarge to the selected river basin, select \u201cOther, please specify\u201d and specify the\nlocal aquifer source.\n\u2022 You may provide the sub-basin details using the \u201cOther, please specify\u201d option in the\nfollowing format: \u201cPutumayo, Amazon\u201d.\n\u2022 For full instructions regarding this list, see CDP\u2019s Full Corporate Questionnaire:\nOverview.\nNumber of facilities within direct operations exposed to water-related risk in this river basin\n(column 3)\n\u2022 This column only appears if you select \u201cDirect Operations\u201d in column 2 \u201cValue chain\nstages where facilities at risk have been identified in this river basin\u201d.\n\u2022 Report the number of facilities within your direct operations exposed to water-related\nrisk in the selected river basin.\n\u2022 The term \u2018facilities\u2019 may be used broadly to describe different types of business\noperations as well as fixed buildings or factories.\n% of your organization\u2019s total facilities within direct operations exposed to water-related risk in this\nriver basin (column 4)\n\u2022 Indicate the proportion of facilities out of your organization\u2019s total number of facilities\nwithin direct operations that are exposed to water-related risk in the specified river\nbasin.

The financial effects of environmental opportunities on\norganizations are not always clear or direct, and for many organizations there might be\nmore than one financial effect associated with an environmental opportunity.\n\u2022 Select the option that you deem to have the biggest effect. You can provide additional\ndetails on other financial effects in column 24 \u201cExplanation of financial effect figures\u201d.\nMagnitude (column 13)\n\u2022 The magnitude describes the extent to which the effect, if it occurred, would affect your\nbusiness. This should consider the business as a whole and therefore the magnitude\ncan reflect both the opportunity and the extent to which it applies throughout the\norganization.\n\u2022 An assessment of the \u2018magnitude\u2019 of the potential financial benefit arising from an\nabsolute value will vary in scale and metric from organization to organization so it is\nnot possible for CDP to accurately define the terms for magnitude. For example, two\norganizations may report a potential financial effect figure of $500,000. For\norganization A this could represent a 1% increase in profits, but a 15% increase in\nrevenue for organization B. Therefore, organizations are asked to determine\nmagnitude on a qualitative 5-point scale from High to Low.\n\u2022 Factors to consider include:\no The proportion of business units affected;\no The size of the effect on those business units; and\no The potential for shareholder or customer response.\n\u2022 If the financial effect has not been assessed by your organization, select \u201cUnknown\u201d.\nPage 159 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net\n\nEffect / Anticipated effect of the opportunity on the financial position, financial performance and\ncash flows of the organization [in the reporting year / in the selected time horizons] (column 14\n& 15)\n\u2022 These columns appear dependent on selections in column 11 \u201cTime horizon over\nwhich\u2026\u201d.\n\u2022 Provide details on the effects of the opportunity on financial position (e.g. assets and\nliabilities), financial performance (e.g., revenue or expenditure) and cash flows of your\norganization:\no Examples of reasons why no quantitative figure can be included are: \u201cthe\neffects are not separately identifiable\u201d or \u201cthe level of measurement\nuncertainty is too high such that quantitative information about this opportunity\nwould not be useful\u201d.\no In the latter case, this column should also be used to provide a description of\nthe financial effect in relative terms (for example as a percentage relative to a\nstated or publicly available figure) or give a qualitative estimate of the financial\neffect.

For example, if your\nChief Sustainability Officer has ultimate accountability for water-related issues as indicated in\ncolumn 1 \u201cPositions of individuals or committees with accountability for this environmental\nissue\u201d, the responsibility for integrating water-related issues into \u201creviewing and guiding\nannual budgets\u201d may fall under the remit of the Chief Financial Officer.

For financial institutions, these effects may materialize via the organization\u2019s\nown operations, the financial products and services offered to its clients, and/or its\ninvestments. This column seeks insight on whether an organization\u2019s board considers:\n\u2022 how the risks posed, or opportunities presented by\nenvironmental issues affect its business; and conversely\n\u2022 how its business activities impact the environment, either\npositively or negatively.\nPlease explain (column 7)\n\u2022 Describe the governance mechanisms selected in column 5 \u201cGovernance mechanisms into\nwhich this environmental issue is integrated\u201d and explain how these mechanisms contribute\nto the board's overall oversight of the environmental issue in column 0 \u201cEnvironmental\nissue\u201d. For example, if in the row \u201cClimate change\u201d you selected in column 5 \u201cOverseeing the\nsetting of corporate targets\u201d and \u201cMonitoring progress towards corporate targets\u201d, describe\nthe process for how the board oversees and monitors your organization\u2019s climate-related\ntargets and progress towards those targets.\n\u2022 Include details such as examples of specific board agenda items related to the environmental\nissue (e.g. Water, Sanitation and Hygiene, or emissions reporting obligations), information on\nwho briefs the board and on which matters (e.g., \"a report from each Business Head\nregarding progress towards climate-related targets is reviewed quarterly by the board\"), and\ndetails of the process of integrating the environmental issue into your organization\u2019s\ngovernance mechanisms.\n\u2022 Provide examples of decisions the positions/committees selected in column 1 \u201cPosition of\nindividual or committee with accountability for this environmental issue\u201d have made or\ncontributed to with respect to the board\u2019s oversight of the environmental issue in column 0\n\u201cEnvironmental issue\u201d via the governance mechanisms selected in column 5 \u201cGovernance\nmechanisms into which this environmental issue is integrated\u201d.

Collecting feedback on the climate transition plan\nallows shareholders to review and raise resolutions related to progress. This question provides\ntransparency regarding an organization\u2019s transition plans and associated feedback\nmechanisms.\nAmbition \u2022 The organization has a publicly available 1.5\u00b0C-aligned climate transition plan in\nplace.\nPage 239 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net\n\n\u2022 The organization discloses the key assumptions used in developing its transition plan\nand anything that the transition plan is reliant upon.\n\u2022 The transition plan has a well-defined feedback mechanism in place, where relevant\nstakeholders can provide input. For example, a shareholder vote at an organization's\nAGM.\n\u2022 The transition plan is developed in the context of a robust climate-related and, where\nrelevant, other environmental dependencies, impacts, risk and opportunities\nassessment. The plan should demonstrate how the organization intends on managing\nclimate-related dependencies and impacts whilst mitigating identified risks and\nrealizing identified opportunities.\n\u2022 The transition plan is supported by credible science-based targets (i.e., 1.5\u00b0C-aligned\nand net zero targets), and progress against these targets should be measurable and\ndisclosed.\n\u2022 The organization outlines the decarbonization levers they plan to use, and the plan\noutlines the mitigation and adaptation actions they need to take now and in the future\nto achieve the goals of the transition plan and meet the associated targets. This\nincludes actions both within their own operations and throughout the value chain,\nincluding changes to products and services, changes in business model and\nengagement strategies e.g. procurement strategy, policy engagement strategy.\n\u2022 The transition plan contains verifiable and quantifiable key performance indicators\n(KPIs) which measure the success of an organization\u2019s climate transition and are\ntracked regularly.\n\u2022 The organization has developed a plan for how the actions needed to achieve the\ntransition plan objectives will be resourced (i.e., where the investment for the\nimplementation of the plan will come from), and any preconditions to this financing.\n\u2022 The organization leverages sustainable finance instruments, where possible. For\nexample, the organization may use sustainable finance taxonomies to identify products\nand services they should invest in to achieve the transition plan objectives.\nConnection to other IFRS S2 14\nframeworks TCFD Strategy B\nNZAM Commitment 10\nESRS 2\nE SRS E1\n1 2 3 4 5 6\nTransition plan Temperature Publicly available Plan explicitly commits to Description of Explain why your\nalignment of climate transition cease all spending activities organization does not\ntransition plan plan on, and revenue included in explicitly commit to\ngeneration from, activitie commitment cease all spending\ns that contribute to fossil and on and revenue\nfuel expansion implementation generation from activitie\nof s that contribute to fossil\ncommitment fuel expansion\nSelect from: Select from: Select from: Select from: Text field Text field [maximum\n\u2022 Yes [maximum 2,500 characters]\n\u2022 Yes, we have a \u2022 Well-below 2\u00b0C \u2022 Yes \u2022 No, but we plan to 2,500\nclimate transition aligned \u2022 No add an explicit characters]\nplan which aligns \u2022 2\u00b0C aligned commitment within the\nwith a 1.5\u00b0C world \u2022 Other, please next two years\n\u2022 No, but we have specify \u2022 No, and we do not\na climate transition plan to add an explicit\nplan with a different commitment within the\ntemperature next two years\nalignment\n\u2022 No, but we are\ndeveloping a climate\ntransition plan within\nthe next two years\nPage 240 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net\n\n\u2022 No, and we do\nnot plan to develop a\nclimate transition\nplan within the next\ntwo years\n7 8 9 10 11 12\nMechanism by which feedback Description of Frequency of feedback Description of key Description of Attach any\nis collected from shareholders feedback collection assumptions and progress against relevant\non your climate transition plan mechanism dependencies on transition plan documents\nwhich the disclosed in which detail your\ntransition plan current or climate transition\nrelies previous plan (optional)\nreporting period\nSelect from: Text field Select from: Text field Text field [Functionality\n[maximum 2,500 \u2022 More frequently than [maximum 2,000 [maximum 3,000 that allows for\n\u2022 Our climate transition plan characters] annually characters] characters] several\nis voted on at Annual General \u2022 Annually attachments]\nMeetings (AGMs) \u2022 Less frequently than\n\u2022 Our climate transition plan annually\nis voted on at AGMs and we\nalso have an additional\nfeedback mechanism in place\n\u2022 We have a different\nfeedback mechanism in place\n\u2022 We do not have a\nfeedback mechanism in place,\nbut we plan to introduce one\nwithin the next two years\n\u2022 We do not have a feedback\nmechanism in place, and we do\nnot plan to introduce one within\nthe next two years\n\u2022 Not applicable as our\norganization does not have\nshareholders\n13 14 15 16\nOther environmental issues Explain how the other Primary reason for not having Explain why your\nthat your climate transition plan environmental issues a climate transition plan that organization does not\nconsiders are considered in your aligns with a 1.5\u00b0C world have a climate\nclimate transition plan transition plan that\naligns with a 1.5\u00b0C\nworld\nSelect all that apply: Text field [maximum Select from: Text field [maximum\n2,500 characters] 2,500 characters]\n\u2022 Forests \u2022 Lack of internal resources,\n\u2022 Plastics capabilities, or expertise (e.g.,\n\u2022 Water due to organization size)\n\u2022 Biodiversity \u2022 No standardized procedure\n\u2022 Other, please specify \u2022 Not an immediate strategic\npriority\n\u2022 No other environmental\n\u2022 Judged to be unimportant or\nissue considered\nnot relevant\n\u2022 Other, please specify\nRequested content General\n\u2022 A credible transition plan refers to a plan which contains relevant information on how your\norganizations plans on achieving your strategy to pivot your existing assets, operations, and\nentire business model towards a trajectory aligned with the latest and most ambitious\nPage 241 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net\n\nclimate science recommendations. i.e., halving greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030\nand reaching net zero by 2050 at the latest, thereby limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\u2022 CDP recommends that a transition plan is succinctly integrated into existing mainstream\nfilings and provides a well-defined feedback mechanism.

turnover, CAPEX, and, where applicable, OPEX in the reporting year\nwhich, in relation to a selected activity, is:\no Taxonomy-aligned: meets the criteria prescribed under a sustainable finance\ntaxonomy;\no Taxonomy-eligible but not aligned: does not meet the criteria prescribed\nunder a sustainable finance taxonomy;\n\u2022 Note that the information provided in this question should be limited to activities which are\neligible (or aligned) under a sustainable finance taxonomy (i.e., activities which are\neligible to be classified as environmentally sustainable under the taxonomy).\n\u2022 If you are disclosing information under the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities, you\nshould report each of Revenue/Turnover, CAPEX, and, where applicable, OPEX for your\nselected activities.\n\u2022 If you have obtained third party verification/assurance for your taxonomy-alignment data,\nyou will have the opportunity to indicate this in 5.4.3 and 13.1.\n\u2022 See \u201cExplanation of terms\u201d for more information.\nEconomic activity (column 1)\n\u2022 Select the option that best describes the activity for which you are disclosing financial\ninformation on taxonomy-eligibility or -alignment.\n\u2022 The list of economic activities corresponds to the classification of environmentally\nsustainable economic activities included within the Climate Delegated Act to the EU\nTaxonomy Regulation. Organizations reporting against taxonomies other than the EU\nTaxonomy should select the closest approximation of the activity for which you wish to\nreport information, based on their given description within the Climate Delegated Act.\nWhilst the EU Taxonomy list of activities are largely based on the Nomenclature of\nEconomic Activities (NACE), note that these references are only indicative and not\nexhaustive. Therefore, even in the absence of a NACE sector reference in the Climate\nDelegated Act, an economic activity that you wish to report on may yet match the activity\ndescription laid out by the Act and be eligible for reporting.\n\u2022 If an activity comprises elements that are both taxonomy-aligned and taxonomy-eligible\nbut not aligned (e.g., the activity meets the criteria prescribed under the taxonomy for\nPage 267 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net\n\nsome of your organization\u2019s facilities but not others), add two separate rows for that\nactivity. In one row, provide financial information for the proportion that is taxonomy-\naligned, and in the other, provide financial information for the proportion that is taxonomy-\neligible but not aligned. Select the relevant option in column 3 to indicate which type of\ntaxonomy alignment you are reporting for each row.\n\u2022 Organizations disclosing information under the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities\nmay also report eligibility figures for each financial metric if their activities correspond to\nany of the 12 new activities added following a 2023 amendment to the Climate Delegated\nAct.\nTaxonomy under which information is being reported (column 2)\n\u2022 If you wish to provide financial information on your organization\u2019s alignment with an\nactivity-level sustainable finance taxonomy that is not listed, select \u201cOther, please specify\u201d\nand provide the name of the taxonomy.\nTaxonomy Alignment (column 3)\n\u2022 Select \u201cTaxonomy-aligned\" to report financial information for an activity (or a proportion of\nan activity) which meets the criteria prescribed under the sustainable finance taxonomy\nselected in column 2 in the reporting year.\n\u2022 Select \u201cTaxonomy-eligible but not aligned\u201d to report financial information for an activity (or\na proportion of an activity) which does not meet the criteria prescribed under the\nsustainable finance taxonomy selected in column 2 in the reporting year.\n\u2022 If you are disclosing information under the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities,\nselecting \u201cTaxonomy-aligned\u201d in this column indicates that you are able to provide\ninformation in columns 28-31 of this question and column 1 of 5.4.2 as per the\nrequirements of Article 3 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\n\u2022 \u201cTaxonomy-eligible, alignment not assessed\u201d will only appear if you are disclosing\ninformation under the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities and have selected one of\nthe 12 newly added activities in column 1 (refer to Annex I of the 2023 amendment to the\nClimate Delegated Act for the list of newly added activities). If you wish to disclose\ninformation for any of the new activities, you will only have the option to report eligibility\nfigures. Please add rows to report your eligibility figures per financial metric for each\nactivity separately.\n\u2022 Your selection in this column will drive the appearance of subsequent columns.\nFinancial metrics (column 4)\n\u2022 Select the financial metrics you would like to provide information for.\n\u2022 If you are disclosing information under the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities, you\nshould select turnover, CAPEX, and, if relevant, OPEX for each row reported, i.e., for\neach taxonomy-aligned activity (or proportion of an activity) and each taxonomy-eligible\nbut not aligned activity (or proportion of an activity).\n\u2022 Your selections in this column will drive the appearance of subsequent columns.\nTypes of substantial contribution (column 5)\n\u2022 This column is presented if \u201cTaxonomy-aligned\u201d is selected in column 3 \u201cTaxonomy\nalignment\u201d.\n\u2022 Select the types of substantial contribution to climate change mitigation and/or climate\nchange adaptation you are disclosing for the activity selected in column 1:\no Own performance: the activity is being performed in a way that it itself\ncontributes substantially by making a positive impact or removing a negative\nimpact on climate change mitigation. For example, where the activity is already\nlow-carbon. If you are disclosing alignment against the EU Taxonomy for\nSustainable Activities, note that activities are considered substantially\ncontributing through own performance if they meet the corresponding technical\nscreening criteria established by the Climate Delegated Act (Annex I- pg. 12-\n140).\nPage 268 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net\n\no Adapted activity: the activity is being performed in a way that it itself\ncontributes substantially by making a positive impact or removing a negative\nimpact on climate change adaptation. For example, where the activity adopts\nadaptation solutions. If you are disclosing alignment against the EU Taxonomy\nfor Sustainable Activities, note that activities may qualify as substantially\ncontributing through own performance if they meet the corresponding technical\nscreening criteria established by the Climate Delegated Act (Annex II- pg. 146-\n346).\no Transitional activity: the activity does not have a technologically or\neconomically feasible low-carbon alternative, but substantially contributes to\nclimate change mitigation by supporting the transition to a net-zero carbon\neconomy consistent with a pathway to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C\nabove preindustrial levels.\no Activity enabling climate change mitigation: the activity enables a\nsubstantial contribution to be made to climate change mitigation in other\nactivities. For example, the activity enables other activities to achieve emissions\nreductions.\no Activity enabling climate change adaptation: the activity enables a\nsubstantial contribution to be made to climate change adaptation in other\nactivities. For example, the activity is developing adaptation solutions.\n\u2022 If you are disclosing against the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities, you are\nencouraged to use the EU Taxonomy Compass tool developed by the EU Commission,\nto determine whether an activity is enabling or transitional.\n\u2022 If the activity substantially contributes to both climate change mitigation and climate\nchange adaptation, select all types of substantial contribution across both objectives. For\nexample, an activity may contribute substantially to climate change mitigation based on\nits own performance, and also enable climate change adaptation.\nTaxonomy-aligned [turnover/CAPEX/OPEX] from this activity in the reporting year (currency)\n(columns 6, 13, 20)\n\u2022 These columns are presented if \u201cTaxonomy-aligned\u201d is selected in column 3 \u201cTaxonomy\nalignment\u201d.

As water becomes increasingly scarce and contested,\nbusinesses could see prices increase. Applying an internal price on water that more accurately\nreflects the costs of the organization\u2019s water provision can help it understand opportunities for\nefficiencies and prepare for potential future price changes.\nAs part of their assessment of an organization\u2019s resilience, it is useful for data users to know if\norganizations are using an internal price on water. This information allows data users to assess\nhow effectively an organization implements its internal water price to achieve its environmental\nobjectives.\nAmbition \u2022 The organization applies internal environmental pricing schemes to incentivize the\nconsideration of environmental issues in risk assessment and decision making, and in\nthe implementation of its environmental policies and targets.\n\u2022 The organization discloses the internal price in units of the organization\u2019s reporting\ncurrency per megaliter of water.\n\u2022 The organization discloses the type of internal water pricing scheme used (e.g., a\nshadow price) and the scope of the application of the scheme (e.g., activities,\nPage 308 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net\n\ngeographies).

An internal fee mechanism\napproach results in actual financial flows as the collected revenue is reinvested back into\ntechnological advancement and other activities that help the organization achieve its\nenvironmental targets.\n\u2022 Implicit price: dividing the cost of water abatement/treatment by the corresponding\nquantity used in cubic meters. An implicit price is calculated retroactively, after an\norganization achieves its desired environmental reductions. This calculation helps\nquantify the capital investments required to meet environment-related targets and is\nfrequently used as a benchmark for implementing a more strategic internal price on\nexternalities. This metric can be used as a benchmark for establishing a strategic internal\npricing mechanism for water.\n\u2022 Internal trading: mechanisms which allow internal business units to trade allocated\ncredits for water usage.\nPage 310 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net\n\nObjectives for implementing internal price (column 2)\n\u2022 Select your organization\u2019s objectives for implementing the internal water price.

The organization provides an explanation for why the\nparticular method was chosen.\nConnection to other IFRS S2 29\nframeworks RE100\nESRS 2\nResponse options Please complete the following table:\n0 1 2\nEnvironmental issue Consolidation approach used Provide the rationale for the choice of\nconsolidation approach\nClimate change Select from: Text field [maximum 2,500 characters]\n\u2022 Financial control\n\u2022 Operational control\n\u2022 Equity share\n\u2022 Other, please specify\nForests\nWater\nPlastics\nBiodiversity\nRequested content General\n\u2022 The \u201cconsolidation approach\u201d identifies which entities are included within the\ncalculation of your environmental performance data and determines the\ninformation that is relevant for your organization to disclose within Modules 7-12.\nPage 366 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net\n\n\u2022 CDP recommends that you consult your legal or accounting advisor when\ndetermining your consolidation approach.\n\u2022 This question is asking you to provide details on your consolidation approach\nonly. You will be able to indicate exclusions to your environmental performance\ndata from the boundary determined by this approach later in the relevant\nenvironmental performance module for each relevant environmental issue.\n\u2022 In line with the Science-Based Targets Network (SBTN), organizations should\nuse the same consolidation approach across environmental issues and use the\nfinancial or operational control approach when setting science-based targets for\nnature. Refer to the SBTN Technical Guidance Step 1 Assess for more details.\n\u2022 Organizations who have used the GHG Protocol for emissions accounting are\nstrongly recommended by SBTN to use the same consolidation approach for\nsetting science-based targets for nature. For example, if your organization uses\nthe financial control approach for consolidating GHG emissions, then you should\nuse the same approach to consolidate other environmental data.\nConsolidation approach used (column 1)\n\u2022 Select the consolidation approach that best reflects the approach used to\nattribute environmental impacts to your organization.\n\u2022 In row \u201cClimate change\u201d, select the consolidation approach used to consolidate\nyour GHG inventory. To support the use, tracking, and comparability of reported\nGHG information, respondents are encouraged to adopt the consolidation\napproaches based on the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, outlined in more\ndetail in Chapter 3 of the Standard.\n\u2022 If you have previously disclosed data to CDP and your consolidation approach\nhas changed in the reporting year, select your new approach in the relevant row.\nIf your consolidation approach in row \u201cClimate change\u201d has changed in the\nreporting year, you should also provide details of the change in 7.1.2.\n\u2022 The drop-down options are based on the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, and\nare described in more detail below (text adapted from the GHG Protocol\nCorporate Standard)\no Financial control: An organization has financial control over an\noperation if it has the ability to direct the financial and operating policies of\nthe operation with a view to gaining economic benefits from its activities.\nGenerally, an organization has financial control over an operation for\nGHG accounting purposes if the operation is treated as a group company\nor subsidiary for the purposes of financial consolidation.\no Operational control: An organization has operational control over an\noperation if it or one of its subsidiaries has the full authority to introduce\nand implement its operating policies at the operation.\no Equity share: Under the equity share approach, an organization\naccounts for GHG emissions from operations according to its share of\nequity in the operation. The equity share reflects the economic interest,\nwhich is the extent of rights an organization has to the risks and rewards\nflowing from an operation. Typically, the share of economic risks and\nrewards in an operation is aligned with the organization\u2019s percentage\nownership of that operation, and equity share will normally be the same\nas the ownership percentage. Where this is not the case, the economic\nsubstance of the relationship the company has with the operation always\noverrides the legal ownership form to ensure the equity share reflects the\npercentage of economic interest. The principle of economic substance\ntaking precedence over legal form is consistent with international financial\nreporting standards.\nPage 367 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net\n\no Other, please specify: Select this option if none of the other options\napply. If you select this option, provide a label in the text field provided.\n\u2022 In the case of leasing arrangements, see the GHG Protocol Appendix:\nCategorizing GHG Emissions from Leased Assets and the lease accounting\nstandard from your relevant generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to\ndetermine the appropriate scope for those emissions.\nProvide the rationale for the choice of consolidation approach (column 2)\n\u2022 For example, if you have used the same consolidation approach for reporting\nwater and forests-related data due to alignment with SBTN guidance, then state\nthis here.\n\u2022 If you have used the same consolidation approach as used in your financial\naccounting, then state this here.\n\u2022 If you have used a different consolidation approach for consolidating different\ntypes of environmental data, explain the rationale for this difference. For\nexample, if you use a different consolidation approach for GHG emissions\naccounting and for water accounting, explain why.\nAuthoring notes\nTags\nCorporate authority Capital Markets\nEnvironmental Issue Question level All\n(Theme)\nSector Question level All\nPage 368 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net",
