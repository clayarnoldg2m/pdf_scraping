Provide aggregated\ndata.\n• Waste can include tire-derived fuels and other refuse-derived fuels. When reporting in this\ncategory, only report the nameplate capacity and gross electricity generation data from the\nnon-biomass fraction. The biomass fraction should be reported under either biomass\noption.\n• Hydropower does not include pumped storage operations for the reporting of nameplate\ncapacity and gross electricity generation. CDP regards it as a form of managing or storing\nenergy rather than primary generation. Note you will be asked to report water accounting\nvolumes for these operations.\n• “Other renewable” and “Other non-renewable” are aggregations of any other renewable\nand non-renewable energy generation technologies you use that are not listed (e.g.\nrenewably derived hydrogen or hydrogen derived from fossil fuels, respectively).\n• If your organization’s power plant capacity combines various small-scale generation\ntechnologies that are challenging to report individually, you can group them as either\nrenewable or non-renewable sources. Report the total capacity of aggregated renewable\nsources under “Other renewable” and the total capacity of aggregated non-renewable\nsources under the “Other non-renewable”. You can explain the methodology utilized and\nlist the small-scale technologies used in the comment section.\nComment (column 5) (optional)\n• Use this column to provide any additional relevant information.\n• If you report information in the “Sustainable biomass” row, provide the criteria used to\nclassify the biomass as sustainable (e.g. certification).\n• If you report information in any of the biomass rows, specify if the biomass technology\nrefers to bioenergy plants fitted with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)."

While many organizations conduct operational and financial\nplanning over a 1–2-year timeframe, and strategic and capital planning over a 2-5-year\ntimeframe, environmental risks and opportunities may have implications over a longer period.\nIt is therefore important for organizations to consider the appropriate timeframes when\nassessing environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities."

For example, the market value\nof a company is affected by assets that have decreased in value because there is\ninsufficient freshwater for the production process, or the value of the business’\nproduction process is reduced by the emergence of new technologies that require\nless water to operate;\no Reputation – Changes in perception concerning an organization’s actual or\nperceived nature impacts, including at the local, economic and societal level. This\ncan result from direct company impacts, industry impacts and/or impacts of\nactivities upstream and/or downstream in a value chain.\no Liability – Liability risks that arise directly or indirectly from legal claims. As laws,\nregulations and case law related to an organization’s preparedness for nature\naction evolves, the incident or probability of contingent liabilities arising from an\norganization may increase.\nFurther details of process (column 13)"

          "1": "General\n• This question seeks to define and quantify how your organization defines a ‘substantive\neffect’ on your organization at the corporate level, in the context of environmental risks\nand opportunities. This will be used to understand the threshold for your reported risks\nand opportunities in 3.1 and 3.6.\n• What constitutes a substantive effect will vary between organizations. You are\ntherefore asked to determine ‘substantive’ in the way that you would do for your\nbusiness decision-making. For example, a 1% reduction in profits will have different\neffects on different organizations depending on its respective profit margins. A\nsubstantive effect of relatively high magnitude could occur because of a large impact\non one of the following aspects, or because of a small number for all three combines\nto create a larger effect:\no the proportion of business units affected;\no the size of the effect on those business units;\no the dependency of the organization on that unit; and/or\no the potential for shareholder or customer concern.\n• Use the “Add row” function if you define a substantive effect on your organization with\nrespect to risks or opportunities in more than one way. For example, if you use\nmultiple indicators or have different definitions for different parts of the business.\nMetrics considered in definition (column 7)\n• This column seeks to capture the different factors taken into account when defining a\nsubstantive effect on your organization with respect to risks and opportunities.\n• If you have provided a quantitative definition, these metrics could give further context\nto your quantitative indicator. For example, you may define risks to be substantive if\nthey could lead to a 10% decrease in revenue over your short-term time horizon (as\ndefined in 2.1). In this case, select “Time horizon over which the effect occurs” and\nprovide further details in column 8 “Application of definition”.\n• If you are only providing a qualitative definition, select all relevant metrics used to\ndefine a substantive effect, or use “Other, please specify” to specify a different metric.\nApplication of definition (column 8)\n• Describe the thresholds considered to be substantive for the metrics reported in\ncolumn 7 “Metrics considered in definition”. For example:\no Frequency of effect occurring: i.e. once, quarterly, every two years etc.\no Time horizon over which the effect occurs: i.e., short-, medium-, and long-\nterm in line with your time horizons reported in 2.1.\no Likelihood of effect occurring: i.e., the percentage chance the effect will occur\n• Often, multiple metrics are used together as part of a matrix approach. If using a\nmatrix approach, describe how the metrics selected in column 7 “Metrics considered\nin definition” are used in combination and their respective weightings.\n• Describe how often the metrics, and their thresholds, are selected, reviewed, and\nupdated."

This column seeks insight on whether an organization’s board considers:\n• how the risks posed, or opportunities presented by\nenvironmental issues affect its business; and conversely\n• how its business activities impact the environment, either\npositively or negatively.\nPlease explain (column 7)\n• Describe the governance mechanisms selected in column 5 “Governance mechanisms into\nwhich this environmental issue is integrated” and explain how these mechanisms contribute\nto the board's overall oversight of the environmental issue in column 0 “Environmental\nissue”. For example, if in the row “Climate change” you selected in column 5 “Overseeing the\nsetting of corporate targets” and “Monitoring progress towards corporate targets”, describe\nthe process for how the board oversees and monitors your organization’s climate-related\ntargets and progress towards those targets.\n• Include details such as examples of specific board agenda items related to the environmental\nissue (e.g. Water, Sanitation and Hygiene, or emissions reporting obligations), information on\nwho briefs the board and on which matters (e.g., \"a report from each Business Head\nregarding progress towards climate-related targets is reviewed quarterly by the board\"), and\ndetails of the process of integrating the environmental issue into your organization’s\ngovernance mechanisms.\n• Provide examples of decisions the positions/committees selected in column 1 “Position of\nindividual or committee with accountability for this environmental issue” have made or\ncontributed to with respect to the board’s oversight of the environmental issue in column 0\n“Environmental issue” via the governance mechanisms selected in column 5 “Governance\nmechanisms into which this environmental issue is integrated”.

With exploratory scenarios, the scenario analysis instead begins\nfrom the present, and then describes a diverse set of plausible future states.\n• Normative scenarios are typically used for assessment and setting of specific targets and\nimplementation plans, while exploratory scenarios are used to assess potential climate-\nrelated risks and uncertainties and test the resiliency of various strategies to a wide range\nof future conditions. The TCFD recommends the use of an exploratory approach.\n• The TNFD Guidance on scenario analysis provides guidance for organizations who choose\nto use scenario analysis to explore the possible consequences of nature loss and climate\nchange."

While a coherent disclosure system with internationally agreed\nstandards and taxonomies is needed to ensure effective data access,\nanalysis, and use by the data users, CDP’s 2025 strategy has highlighted that\na harmonized taxonomy landscape is crucial to support the investment\ndecisions of capital market actors and help to prevent greenwash, as laid\nout in CDP’s policy brief on sustainable finance taxonomies.\n• As a global environmental disclosure system, CDP aims to accelerate the\nimplementation of sustainable finance taxonomies at scale. This is\nreflected in the questions in this module, asking organizations companies\nto report the alignment of their business operations and financial\naccounting with sustainable finance taxonomies, such as the EU\nTaxonomy for Sustainable Activities.\n• These questions are taxonomy-agnostic, allowing organizations\ncompanies to provide information on alignment with any sustainable\nfinance taxonomy.

Note that turnover from adapted activities may\nnot be assessed for climate change adaptation except in specific scenarios. For more\ninformation on addressing double counting, refer to the examples provided in the EU\nCommission FAQs (p15-17).\n• Unless your organization is disclosing alignment against a sustainable finance taxonomy\nwhich requires data to be provided for a specific reporting year, the figures provided\nshould be consistent with the reporting year defined by your answer to 1.4.\n• Organizations disclosing alignment against the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities\nshould provide figures for a January to December reporting period."

A\nshadow price can be used in investment decisions or to set budgets, but no actual\nfinancial flows are generated.\n• Internal fee: mechanisms which charge responsible internal business units for their\nGHG emissions. An internal fee mechanism approach results in actual financial flows as\nthe collected revenue is reinvested back into clean technologies and other activities that\nhelp transition the entire organization towards lower-carbon operations and investments.\n• Implicit price: where the cost of emissions abatement is divided by the tons of CO2e\nabated. An implicit price is calculated retroactively, after the organization achieves its\ndesired emissions reductions. This calculation helps quantify the capital investments\nrequired to meet climate-related targets and is frequently used as a benchmark for\nimplementing a more strategic internal carbon price. Some organizations may also\ninternalize the cost of purchasing carbon credits to set an implicit carbon price.\n• Internal trading: mechanisms which allow internal business units to trade allocated\ncarbon credits.\nObjectives for implementing internal price (column 2)\n• Select your organization’s objectives for implementing the internal carbon price. In many\ncases, organizations report multiple objectives – particularly as developments occur that\nrequire a readjustment of their pricing approach to maximize its effectiveness.\n• The available options reflect the most common objectives that organizations disclose to\nCDP; this list is not exhaustive, and you can specify other objectives by selecting “Other,\nplease specify.”",

The equity share reflects the economic interest,\nwhich is the extent of rights an organization has to the risks and rewards\nflowing from an operation. Typically, the share of economic risks and\nrewards in an operation is aligned with the organization’s percentage\nownership of that operation, and equity share will normally be the same\nas the ownership percentage. Where this is not the case, the economic\nsubstance of the relationship the company has with the operation always\noverrides the legal ownership form to ensure the equity share reflects the\npercentage of economic interest. The principle of economic substance\ntaking precedence over legal form is consistent with international financial\nreporting standards."
