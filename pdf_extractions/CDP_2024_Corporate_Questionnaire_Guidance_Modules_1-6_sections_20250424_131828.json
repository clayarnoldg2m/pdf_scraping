The financial effects of environmental opportunities on\norganizations are not always clear or direct, and for many organizations there might be\nmore than one financial effect associated with an environmental opportunity.\n• Select the option that you deem to have the biggest effect. You can provide additional\ndetails on other financial effects in column 24 “Explanation of financial effect figures”.\nMagnitude (column 13)\n• The magnitude describes the extent to which the effect, if it occurred, would affect your\nbusiness. This should consider the business as a whole and therefore the magnitude\ncan reflect both the opportunity and the extent to which it applies throughout the\norganization.\n• An assessment of the ‘magnitude’ of the potential financial benefit arising from an\nabsolute value will vary in scale and metric from organization to organization so it is\nnot possible for CDP to accurately define the terms for magnitude. For example, two\norganizations may report a potential financial effect figure of $500,000. For\norganization A this could represent a 1% increase in profits, but a 15% increase in\nrevenue for organization B. Therefore, organizations are asked to determine\nmagnitude on a qualitative 5-point scale from High to Low.\n• Factors to consider include:\no The proportion of business units affected;\no The size of the effect on those business units; and\no The potential for shareholder or customer response.\n• If the financial effect has not been assessed by your organization, select “Unknown”."

For example, a shareholder vote at an organization's\nAGM.\n• The transition plan is developed in the context of a robust climate-related and, where\nrelevant, other environmental dependencies, impacts, risk and opportunities\nassessment. The plan should demonstrate how the organization intends on managing\nclimate-related dependencies and impacts whilst mitigating identified risks and\nrealizing identified opportunities.\n• The transition plan is supported by credible science-based targets (i.e., 1.5°C-aligned\nand net zero targets), and progress against these targets should be measurable and\ndisclosed.\n• The organization outlines the decarbonization levers they plan to use, and the plan\noutlines the mitigation and adaptation actions they need to take now and in the future\nto achieve the goals of the transition plan and meet the associated targets. This\nincludes actions both within their own operations and throughout the value chain,\nincluding changes to products and services, changes in business model and\nengagement strategies e.g. procurement strategy, policy engagement strategy.\n• The transition plan contains verifiable and quantifiable key performance indicators\n(KPIs) which measure the success of an organization’s climate transition and are\ntracked regularly.\n• The organization has developed a plan for how the actions needed to achieve the\ntransition plan objectives will be resourced (i.e., where the investment for the\nimplementation of the plan will come from), and any preconditions to this financing.\n• The organization leverages sustainable finance instruments, where possible. For\nexample, the organization may use sustainable finance taxonomies to identify products\nand services they should invest in to achieve the transition plan objectives."

A\nshadow price can be used in investment decisions or to set budgets, but no actual\nfinancial flows are generated.\n• Internal fee: mechanisms which charge responsible internal business units for their\nGHG emissions. An internal fee mechanism approach results in actual financial flows as\nthe collected revenue is reinvested back into clean technologies and other activities that\nhelp transition the entire organization towards lower-carbon operations and investments.\n• Implicit price: where the cost of emissions abatement is divided by the tons of CO2e\nabated. An implicit price is calculated retroactively, after the organization achieves its\ndesired emissions reductions. This calculation helps quantify the capital investments\nrequired to meet climate-related targets and is frequently used as a benchmark for\nimplementing a more strategic internal carbon price.

For instance, indicate\nwhether you utilized the CEO Water Mandate’s “100 Priority Basins ” list to\nassess supplier locations and prioritize engagement with suppliers situated in\none of these priority basins.\n• If your threshold is based on multiple criteria selected in column 2 “Criteria for\nassessing supplier dependencies and/or impacts on the environment”, specify the\nthreshold for each criterion selected. The cumulative outcome of these thresholds\nshould be used to determine the percentage and number of tier 1 suppliers in the\nfollowing columns.\n% tier 1 suppliers meeting the thresholds for substantive dependencies and/or impacts on the\nenvironment (column 5)\n• Out of the tier 1 suppliers assessed for the criteria selected in column 2 “Criteria for\nassessing supplier dependencies and/or impacts on the environment”, provide the\npercentage of suppliers identified to have substantive dependencies and/or impacts on\nthe environment, as per the thresholds defined in column 4 “Define a threshold for",

For example, you may define risks to be substantive if\nthey could lead to a 10% decrease in revenue over your short-term time horizon (as\ndefined in 2.1). In this case, select “Time horizon over which the effect occurs” and\nprovide further details in column 8 “Application of definition”.\n• If you are only providing a qualitative definition, select all relevant metrics used to\ndefine a substantive effect, or use “Other, please specify” to specify a different metric.\nApplication of definition (column 8)\n• Describe the thresholds considered to be substantive for the metrics reported in\ncolumn 7 “Metrics considered in definition”. For example:\no Frequency of effect occurring: i.e. once, quarterly, every two years etc.\no Time horizon over which the effect occurs: i.e., short-, medium-, and long-\nterm in line with your time horizons reported in 2.1.\no Likelihood of effect occurring: i.e., the percentage chance the effect will occur\n• Often, multiple metrics are used together as part of a matrix approach. If using a\nmatrix approach, describe how the metrics selected in column 7 “Metrics considered\nin definition” are used in combination and their respective weightings.\n• Describe how often the metrics, and their thresholds, are selected, reviewed, and\nupdated.",

However, if organization A relies on that facility for\n90% of its production capacity and organization B relies on it for only 40% of its production\ncapacity, the magnitude of a sea level rise effect on organization A will be comparatively\nhigher than that on company B.\n• It is not possible for CDP to accurately define terms for magnitude as they will vary from\norganization to organization. For example, a 1% reduction in profits will have different\neffects on different organizations depending on the profit margins on which they work.\nTherefore, organizations are asked to determine magnitude on a qualitative scale. Factors\nto consider include:\no The proportion of business units affected;\no The size of the effect on those business units;\no The dependency of the company on those units; and\no The potential for shareholder or customer concern.\n• If the financial effect has not been assessed by your organization, select “Unknown”.\nEffect/Anticipated effect of the risk on the financial position, financial performance and cash\nflows of the organization in the [reporting year/selected future time horizons] (columns 16 & 17)\n• These columns appear dependent on selections in column 13 “Time horizon over which…”.\n• If a quantitative figure cannot be provided, explain why the figure cannot be provided and describe\nthe financial effect in relative terms (e.g., as a percentage relative to a stated or publicly available\nfigure) or provide a qualitative estimate. Otherwise, if you are unable to provide any information\nto quantify the effect, state “The effect has not been quantified financially”.\n• Examples of reasons for being unable to provide a quantitative figure include: “the\neffects are not separately identifiable” or “the level of measurement uncertainty is too\nhigh, rendering quantitative information about this risk not useful”.\n• In the latter case, this column should also be used to provide a description of the\nfinancial effect in relative terms (for example as a percentage relative to a stated or\npublicly available figure) or give a qualitative estimate of the financial effect.\nOtherwise, if you have no information about the financial effect, please state “The\neffect has not been quantified financially”.

Provide the\nestimated figure/range for the financial effect per future time horizon, prior to considering\nany mitigation measures in place.\n• This figure should be in the same currency that you selected in 1.2 for all financial\ninformation disclosed throughout your response.\no Financial figures should reflect the effect of the risk on your organization’s\nfinancial performance, such as revenue and costs and its financial position,\nsuch as assets and liabilities.\no For example, for organizations with a medium-term horizon of 3-5 years, a\ncumulative figure/range should be provided for the years covered by the time\nhorizon.\n• For risks which have had an effect in the reporting year (column 19 “Financial effect figure in the\nreporting year (currency)”), consider the following when calculating the financial effect of the risk,\nalongside any other relevant financial effect of the risk:"

For example, if in the row “Climate change” you selected in column 5 “Overseeing the\nsetting of corporate targets” and “Monitoring progress towards corporate targets”, describe\nthe process for how the board oversees and monitors your organization’s climate-related\ntargets and progress towards those targets.\n• Include details such as examples of specific board agenda items related to the environmental\nissue (e.g. Water, Sanitation and Hygiene, or emissions reporting obligations), information on\nwho briefs the board and on which matters (e.g., \"a report from each Business Head\nregarding progress towards climate-related targets is reviewed quarterly by the board\"), and\ndetails of the process of integrating the environmental issue into your organization’s\ngovernance mechanisms.\n• Provide examples of decisions the positions/committees selected in column 1 “Position of\nindividual or committee with accountability for this environmental issue” have made or\ncontributed to with respect to the board’s oversight of the environmental issue in column 0\n“Environmental issue” via the governance mechanisms selected in column 5 “Governance\nmechanisms into which this environmental issue is integrated”.

For example, if forests-related opportunities have affected your revenue but both climate\nrelated risks and opportunities have affected your revenue, disclose this across separate\nrows.\n• If your risks and/or opportunities have affected your financial planning relating to a financial\nplanning element for the individual environmental issues differently, add a row for each. For\nexample, if your climate-related and water-related risks have affected your capital expenditure\ndifferently, then disclose these in different rows. Whereas, if your climate-related and water-\nrelated risks impacted your capital expenditure in the same way, then disclose these in the\nsame row.\n• If a financial services sector discloser, the environmental risks and/or opportunities to be\nconsidered in this question refer to lending, financial intermediary, investment and/or\ninsurance underwriting activities of your organization, in addition to your operational activities.\nDescribe how environmental risks and opportunities have affected these financial planning\nelements (column 4)\n• Describe how your organization’s financial planning element(s) have been affected by\nenvironmental risks and/or opportunities.

We have also accounted for costs associated with our\nservicing operations which extend to maintenance, repair and meter conversions, amounting to 20% of our total\ncapital expenditure.\nWith smart meter installation and conversion from analogue to digital meters as our special focus, we expect in\nfuture to report taxonomy alignment through substantial contribution to climate change mitigation by own\nperformance as well as by enabling mitigation.\nBy 2025, we expect close to 20% of our CAPEX associated with our smart meter technology designed to\nincrease energy efficiency of low voltage installations, to be aligned with the taxonomy. We are also currently\nscoping out the expansion of our business to distribute software enabling grid simulation to improve\nperformance, which we believe, will increase the proportion of our taxonomy aligned turnover, CAPEX and\nOPEX.",

Applying an internal price on water that more accurately\nreflects the costs of the organization’s water provision can help it understand opportunities for\nefficiencies and prepare for potential future price changes.\nAs part of their assessment of an organization’s resilience, it is useful for data users to know if\norganizations are using an internal price on water.

To support the use, tracking, and comparability of reported\nGHG information, respondents are encouraged to adopt the consolidation\napproaches based on the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, outlined in more\ndetail in Chapter 3 of the Standard.\n• If you have previously disclosed data to CDP and your consolidation approach\nhas changed in the reporting year, select your new approach in the relevant row.\nIf your consolidation approach in row “Climate change” has changed in the\nreporting year, you should also provide details of the change in 7.1.2.\n• The drop-down options are based on the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, and\nare described in more detail below (text adapted from the GHG Protocol\nCorporate Standard)\no Financial control: An organization has financial control over an\noperation if it has the ability to direct the financial and operating policies of\nthe operation with a view to gaining economic benefits from its activities.\nGenerally, an organization has financial control over an operation for\nGHG accounting purposes if the operation is treated as a group company\nor subsidiary for the purposes of financial consolidation.\no Operational control: An organization has operational control over an\noperation if it or one of its subsidiaries has the full authority to introduce\nand implement its operating policies at the operation.\no Equity share: Under the equity share approach, an organization\naccounts for GHG emissions from operations according to its share of\nequity in the operation. The equity share reflects the economic interest,\nwhich is the extent of rights an organization has to the risks and rewards\nflowing from an operation. Typically, the share of economic risks and\nrewards in an operation is aligned with the organization’s percentage\nownership of that operation, and equity share will normally be the same\nas the ownership percentage. Where this is not the case, the economic\nsubstance of the relationship the company has with the operation always\noverrides the legal ownership form to ensure the equity share reflects the\npercentage of economic interest. The principle of economic substance\ntaking precedence over legal form is consistent with international financial\nreporting standards."
