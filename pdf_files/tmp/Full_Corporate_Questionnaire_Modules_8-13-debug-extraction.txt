About this reporting guidance
This document contains the 2025 CDP full corporate questionnaire and reporting guidance. It includes all the questions from
the CDP corporate question bank, across all environmental issues, for all requesting authorities, and all sector-specific
questions and guidance.
Please note that each discloser’s route through the questionnaire is tailored according to their sector, the environmental
issues they are disclosing on, and the organizations that have requested them to disclose. Therefore, not all questions in this
document will be relevant for your organization.
When using our online portal, the questionnaire will be customized specifically for your organization, using the information
you provide in the questionnaire setup process. Your responses to the questions may unlock further questions or modules
in the questionnaire.
See our Introduction to the CDP Corporate Questionnaires and our Knowledge Base to find out more about the CDP
questionnaires and our approach to disclosure.
Below each question in this document there is a ‘Tags’ section, which shows which disclosers will see the question. This is
based on the organizations that have requested them to disclose and the information provided during their questionnaire
setup:
1. Authority Type: who has requested the organization to disclose. For example, if a question is only shown to
organizations who have been requested to disclose by a CDP Supply Chain member, this row of the table will say
“Supply chain”. Questions with “All requesters” in this field will be shown to all disclosers.
2. Environmental Issue: which environmental issues does the question relate to. For example, if a question is only
shown to organizations disclosing on forests, this row of the table will say “F only”.
3. Questionnaire Sector: details of any sector-specific content, based on CDP ACS classification. For example, if a
question is only shown to financial services sector organizations, this row of the table will say “FS only”.
In the example below, the “Tags” table indicates that the question will be shown to organizations who are responding to a
request from a CDP Supply Chain member, are disclosing on water security, and have any CDP ACS sector other than
financial services.

Rationale CDP seeks to share comprehensive and representative data to ensure data users’ confidence in
the information reported. As such, if organizations need to exclude parts of their direct
operations and/or upstream value chain from their disclosure of forests-related data, data users
must be informed of the exclusions as this may affect their analysis.
Ambition The organization reports on all exclusions from the reporting boundary and does not have any
significant exclusions from their disclosure.

Requested General
content • Any environmental performance data relating to groups, companies, businesses or
organizations that is relevant for your organization to disclose under your chosen consolidation
approach, as indicated in 6.1, or that is within your upstream value chain but not included in
your disclosure of forests related data should be disclosed in 8.1.1.
• If your disclosure of forests-related data includes all aspects of your direct operations and/or
upstream value chain, select “No”. If your disclosure of forests-related data excludes certain
aspects of your direct operations and/or upstream value chain, select “Yes”.
11

• If you selected 'No' in column 1 ‘'Is your reporting boundary for your CDP disclosure the same
as that used in your financial statements?’ of 1.5 and there are entities included in your
consolidated accounting group that are not included in your reporting boundary, select 'Yes'
and provide details on the exclusion of these entities in 8.1.1.
• Organizations should report on all exclusions.
• Elements of your business or upstream value chain may be excluded for a number of reasons:
o A geographical location may be excluded if there is no commodity usage or a
current lack of visibility over management practices which makes reporting
unfeasible for operations in that country, area or region until systems have been
put in place;
o An activity (e.g. type of business process, or type of supplier) may be excluded due
to limited data or reporting feasibility;
o Facilities may be excluded due to recent mergers, acquisitions and divestitures
(which have taken place during the reporting year), outsourcing and in-sourcing of
activities (smaller facilities for which it is not currently possible to track
deforestation and/or conversion may also be considered); and
o A specific product line may be excluded due to limited data or reporting feasibility.
• Note that retailers are only expected to report on their own-branded products, excluding
products owned and branded by third parties.
• In all cases, the following principles of relevance and transparency must apply to all
disclosures (adapted from GHG Protocol, 2004):
o Relevance: Ensure the disclosure appropriately reflects the forests-related use of
the company and serves the decision-making needs of users – both internal and
external to the company.
o Transparency: Address all relevant issues in a factual and coherent manner, based
on a clear audit trail. Disclose any relevant assumptions and make appropriate
references to the accounting and calculation methodologies and data sources
used.
Explanation of • Direct operations (also referred to as ‘own operations’): all activities and sites (e.g., buildings,
terms farms, mines, retail stores) over which the reporting organization has operational or financial
control. This covers any internal value chains between the organization’s business units
(adapted from TNFD, 2023; SBTN, 2023).
• Facilities: may be used throughout this questionnaire as a broad term and not restricted to a
particular site or grouping of fixed buildings and factories. For example, if your organization is
in the extractive industries, you might normally collate business information for assets or
business units, and so you may wish to define ‘facility’ information in this way.
• Total commodity volume: the total volume of a commodity produced and/or sourced
(including used, purchased, and consumed) by your organization regardless of whether this
volume is included or excluded from your disclosure.
• Upstream value chain (also referred to as ‘supply chain’): the activities, sites, resources,
relationships, and stakeholders that provide products and/or services to your organization.
This typically involves activities early in the value chain, such as production or development.
The upstream value chain varies depending on the nature of the business but may include raw
material, component, or equipment suppliers (adapted from ESRS, 2023).
Additional The GHG Protocol states that an acknowledgement of all exclusions should be made each year to
information enhance transparency despite disclosure of the same exclusion in previous years. This ensures all
data users are always aware of what data has been included in your response.

Explanation of • Business activity: includes any activity engaged in, with the primary purpose of making a
terms profit. This is a general term that encompasses all the economic activities carried out by a
company during the course of business. This could be a type of business process for
example.
• Embedded soy: indirectly sourced soy used in animal feed during the production of an animal
product, e.g., meat, farmed fish, dairy, eggs, or other animal products as ingredients. The
concept of embedded soy allows organizations to account for the impact of soy from
sourcing animal products despite the organization not sourcing soy or soy products directly.
Soy is ‘embedded’ when it is indirectly sourced and is not physically present in the end product
(adapted from WWF, 2022 and CGF, 2016).
• Geographical area: a location that can include a country, state/region, landscape, biome,
province, municipality or any other national, regional or local administrative division where you
produce/source materials from.
• Specific product line: a group of related products under a single brand sold by the same
company.

Commodity volume data
Section This section requests information on commodity volumes. This is important context for data users
Overview and enables disclosers to provide transparent, comprehensive, and comparable data. CDP requests
details on four types of commodity volumes in the context of disclosure on forests-related data: total
commodity volume, disclosure volume, produced volume and sourced volume. This section gathers
details on the disclosure volume and its breakdown according to the volume that is produced and/or
sourced per commodity. The volumes reported in this section will be referred to throughout the
section and your response here will be used to contextualize subsequent answers.
(8.2) Provide a breakdown of your disclosure volume per commodity.

Rationale Transparency on the commodity volumes included in an organization’s disclosure is key to data
users’ understanding of environmental performance. This question requests the breakdown of
the volume that is being disclosed on (here referred to as the “Disclosure volume”) according to
the volume that is produced (“Produced volume”) and sourced (“Sourced volume”). This
question helps data users to understand and contextualise the volumes that are being reported
on in this module.
Ambition The organization discloses on all commodities and volumes produced and/or sourced.

certain volumes may be excluded.
• Produced volume: the proportion of the "Disclosure volume" that is produced by your
organization e.g., commodities grown, reared or harvested on land owned, managed or
controlled.
• Sourced volume: the proportion of the "Disclosure volume" that is consumed, sourced,
purchased and/or used by your organization for processing, trading or used as an input for
manufacturing and/or packaging. This includes the commodity volume contained within
manufactured goods sold by retailers in addition to the volume of soy embedded in animal
products.
• Total commodity volume: the total volume of a commodity produced and/or sourced
(including used, purchased and consumed) by your organization regardless of whether this
volume is included or excluded from your disclosure.

(8.2.1) Provide details on any soy embedded in animal products sourced by your organization.
Question details
Question This question only appears if you select “Embedded soy only” or “Mixture of embedded soy and
dependencies direct soy” in column 3 “Indicate if you have direct soy and/or embedded soy in your value chain”
of 1.22.
Change from last Modified guidance
year
Rationale Global population growth is increasing the demand for animal products and consequently,
increasing the demand for soy used to feed animals. This growth in soy production is linked to
deforestation and conversion of natural ecosystems and usually goes unaccounted for, as it is
“embedded” or “hidden” in organizations’ value chains. To address this, organizations who source
animal products should: improve their awareness of their embedded soy exposure across the
breadth of their product sourcing; work towards better visibility of their embedded soy origins;
and assess their deforestation-free (DF) or deforestation- and conversion-free (DCF) status of
their embedded soy volume. This question provides investors and other data users transparency
on an organization's embedded soy use, in terms of its associated volume calculation,
traceability, and DCF status.
18

Ambition • The organization includes embedded soy within its disclosure volume with actions to:
o Improve understanding of their value chain and define a policy scope using materiality
assessment across the breadth of product sourcing.
o Progress towards better visibility of embedded soy origin and reduce associated risk of
deforestation and conversion.
o Engage with suppliers and landscape initiatives to promote forest-positive production of
embedded soy.

Requested General
content • This question gathers information on your embedded soy, defined as indirectly sourced soy
used in animal feed during the production of an animal product, e.g., meat, farmed fish, dairy,
eggs, or other animal products as ingredients. The concept of embedded soy allows
organizations to account for the impact of soy from sourcing animal products despite the
organization not sourcing soy or soy products directly.
• This question is only applicable if you indicated in column 3 “Indicate if you have direct soy
and/or embedded soy in your value chain” of 1.22 that you have embedded soy in your value
chain. If you only produce or directly source soy or soy products e.g., animal feed containing
soy, then this should be reported as “Direct soy only” in column 3 of 1.22.
• Note: soy derivatives should be reported as “direct soy” and not as “embedded soy” in 1.22.
Refer to the “Explanation of terms” section below to identify the distinction between the
difference in terms “Embedded soy”, “Direct soy”, and “Derivative”.
• If you have included embedded soy within your "Sourced volume” (i.e., your “Disclosure
volume”) in 8.2, this question will gather further information on your embedded soy to visualise
how embedded soy affects the rest of your disclosure and the progress made on these
volumes.
Disclosure of embedded soy (column 1)
• Selections in this column will determine the presentation of further columns in this table.
• If you select “Some or all of our embedded soy volume is included in our “Sourced volume” as
reported in column 4 of 8.2" you will be asked to provide further information of your embedded
soy volume in this table.
• If you select “All of our embedded soy volume is excluded from our disclosure as reported in
8.1.1”, your total embedded soy volume should be reported in 8.1.1 as an exclusion. In this
case, you will not be presented with columns 3 “Volume calculation methodology” to 12
“Methodology used to determine DF/DCF status”.
Description of embedded soy use and soy tiers (column 2)
• Provide information on the animal products you source and how the soy is embedded within
these products, e.g., “We source products that come from cattle which have been fed soy-
based meal.”
• The Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) “Soy Measurement Ladder” groups products into five tiers.
Each tier contains groupings of similar products for which soy usage occurs at the same point
in the value chain. Tiers 2 to 5 include product groupings that are applicable to embedded soy
users. Use this resource to identify how the animal products you source fall into the different
tiers.
• If possible, provide the different proportions of your embedded soy volume categorized across
the different tiers e.g., “40% of our embedded soy volume falls into Tier 2 (meat, e.g., beef) and
the remainder 60% falls into Tier 3 (eggs and dairy).”
• Indicate whether certain tiers are excluded from your disclosure.
20

Volume calculation methodology (column 3)
• Provide details on the methodology used to calculate your embedded soy volume, including
any references to literature on the conversion factor used or specialist tools such as the RTRS
Soy Footprint Calculator.
• If you are reporting on multiple products that are in different product tiers, where possible,
clarify the methodology used for each tier.
• If you have not calculated your entire embedded soy volume, provide a brief explanation as to
why you are not able to calculate the entire scope of your embedded soy volume.
Embedded soy disclosure volume (metric tons) (column 4)
• State the volume of embedded soy that you source, in metric tons, which is included in your
“Sourced volume” in column 4 of 8.2.
• This is the volume that will be included in your “Disclosure volume” and “Sourced volume”
throughout the environmental performance forests module.
• Do not include any of the embedded soy volume that you have excluded in 8.1.1.
% of sourced volume that is embedded soy (column 5)
• Calculate the percentage of your soy “Sourced volume” reported in column 4 of 8.2, that is your
“Embedded soy disclosure volume” reported in column 4 of this question.
Description of traceability system (column 7)
• This column only appears if “Yes, we have a traceability system for our embedded soy” is
selected in column 6 “Traceability system”.
• Report on the level of traceability of your embedded soy. This includes whether you can trace
to:
o the soy production origin; or
o the soy feed supplier origin; or
o to the origin of the animal that was fed the soy.
• If you have traced back to the soy production origin, indicate if this is to country/area level,
sourcing area or production unit.
• In addition, provide details of the methods and tools used to trace your embedded soy.
% of embedded soy disclosure volume traceable to country/area of soy production (column 8)
• This column only appears if “Yes, we have a traceability system for our embedded soy” is
selected in column 6 “Traceability system”.
• State the percentage of your embedded soy disclosure volume that is traceable back to the
country/area of soy production. For guidance on country/area lists, refer to the CDP technical
note: Countries, Areas and Regions.
% of embedded soy disclosure volume for which the soy production origin is unknown (column 9)
• This column only appears if “Yes, we have a traceability system for our embedded soy” is
selected in column 6 “Traceability system”.
• State the percentage of your embedded soy disclosure volume for which you cannot trace back
to the country/area of soy production. This should also include the volume for which you can
only trace back to the country of animal production or to the soy feed supplier, as this is not
necessarily the country of where the soy was produced and harvested.
• Note: ensure the sum of figures provided here and in column 8 “% of embedded soy
disclosure volume traceable to country/area of soy production” is 100%.
21

DF/DCF status assessed for embedded soy (column 10) - Methodology used to determine DF/DCF status
(column 12)
• Columns 10-12 request information about the DF or DCF status of your “Embedded soy
disclosure volume” reported in column 4. The DF/DCF designation signifies that materials did
not originate from production units where conversion from forests or other natural ecosystems
occurred after a specified cutoff date.
• If you have assessed your DF/DCF status, you will be asked to report the proportion of your
embedded soy disclosure volume that is determined as DF/DCF and the methods you have
used to determine those volumes as DF/DCF.
• The DF/DCF status may be assessed via any of these three methods:
o Certification through schemes providing full DF/DCF assurance
o Production unit level monitoring
o Sourcing area level monitoring
• For volumes reported here to be considered DF/DCF, you must also report a cutoff date in
8.7.1. Cutoff dates provide the basis for calculating your DF/DCF volumes. For example, if you
report a 2020 cutoff date for a soy no-conversion target in 8.7.1, the percentage of your
embedded soy disclosure volume reported as DCF in column 11 must originate from
production units free from deforestation and conversion since 2020.
• Select “Yes, deforestation-free (DF) status assessed” in column 10 “DF/DCF status assessed
for embedded soy” if your organization has assessed whether embedded soy volumes have
contributed to deforestation since a specified cutoff date, and you have a no-deforestation or a
no-conversion target that will be reported on in 8.7.1.
• Select “Yes, deforestation- and conversion-free (DCF) status assessed” in column 10 “DF/DCF
status assessed for embedded soy” if your assessment includes conversion of other natural
ecosystems since a specified cutoff date, and you have a no-conversion target that will be
reported on in 8.7.1.
• For information on DCF accounting and the methods to determine DCF, consult the following
resources:
o the joint AFi, GHG protocol and SBTi FLAG guidance (2023); and,
o the Proforest (2022) Generic Verified Deforestation and Conversion Free (V-DCF)
methodology.
Explanation of • Cutoff date: the date after which deforestation or conversion renders a given area or
terms production unit non-compliant with no-deforestation or no-conversion, commitments, policies,
goals, targets, or other obligations (AFi, 2024).
• Deforestation-free (also referred to as “no-deforestation”): commodity production, sourcing,
or financial investments that do not cause or contribute to deforestation.
o Deforestation-free refers to no gross deforestation of natural forests, which the
Accountability Framework specifies as the appropriate policy and goal on this
topic for companies and supply chains.
o In the context of the Accountability Framework, deforestation refers to the loss of
natural forest (see definition of deforestation).
o The terms “no-deforestation” and “deforestation-free” are used in favor of “zero
deforestation” because “zero” can imply an absolutist approach that may be at
odds with the need sometimes to accommodate minimal levels of conversion at
the site level in the interest of facilitating optimal conservation and production
outcomes (see AFi’s definition for minimal level [of deforestation or conversion],
2024) (adapted from AFi, 2024).
22

• Deforestation- and conversion-free (also referred to as "no-conversion"): commodity
production, sourcing, or financial investments that do not cause or contribute to deforestation
and the conversion of natural ecosystems.
o Conversion-free refers to no gross conversion of natural ecosystems, which the
Accountability Framework specifies as the appropriate policy and goal on this
topic for companies and supply chains.
o Deforestation-free refers to no gross deforestation of natural forests, which the
Accountability Framework specifies as the appropriate policy and goal on this
topic for companies and supply chains.
o In the context of the Accountability Framework, deforestation refers to the loss of
natural forest (see definition of deforestation).
o The terms “no-conversion”, and “deforestation- and conversion-free” are used in
favor of “zero-conversion” because “zero” can imply an absolutist approach that
may be at odds with the need to sometimes accommodate minimal levels of
conversion at the site level in the interest of facilitating optimal conservation and
production outcomes (see AFi’s definition for minimal level [of deforestation or
conversion], 2024) (adapted from AFi, 2024).
• Derivative: a purposely extracted or derived substance from a commodity. Derivatives are
physically present in the end product, e.g., Caprylyl glycol is a fatty acid extracted from palm
oil and is present in many creams and ointments.
• Direct soy: soy or soy products produced and/or directly sourced by an organization, e.g.,
soybean oil, soybean meal and soy derivatives used as ingredients.
• Embedded soy: indirectly sourced soy used in animal feed during the production of an animal
product, e.g., meat, farmed fish, dairy, eggs, or other animal products as ingredients. The
concept of embedded soy allows organizations to account for the impact of soy from
sourcing animal products despite the organization not sourcing soy or soy products directly.
Soy is ‘embedded’ when it is indirectly sourced and is not physically present in the end product
(adapted from WWF, 2022 and CGF, 2016).
• Embedded soy disclosure volume: the volume of embedded soy indirectly sourced by an
organization that will be disclosed on through CDP.
• Traceability system: a system that records and follows the trail of products and/or raw

Explanation of • Certification: the action or process of providing a product with an official document attesting to
terms a status or level of achievement against a certain standard
• Company-affiliated smallholder (also referred to as “scheme smallholder”, “plasma
smallholder” and “out grower”): small-scale agricultural or forest products producers with a
long -term or permanent selling relationship with a given buyer and receive significant levels of
inputs, support, and/or requirements or mandates from that buyer (adapted from AFi, 2020).
• Concession/lease: the right to use land or other property to produce commodities, granted by a
government, company, landholder, or a controlling body.
• Disclosure volume: the volume that your organization includes in its disclosure. Organizations
are encouraged to report the “Total commodity volume” as their “Disclosure volume”, however
certain volumes may be excluded.
• Independent smallholders: small-scale agricultural or forest products producers with
enforceable decision-making power on the operation of the land and production practices, in
addition to freedom to chose how the land will be utilised (adapted from RSPO, 2019).
27

• Produced volume: the proportion of the "Disclosure volume" that is produced by your
organization e.g., commodities grown, reared or harvested on land owned, managed or
controlled.
• Smallholder: small-scale agricultural or forest products producers that are distinct from larger-
scale producers found in similar contexts by virtue of many or all of the following
characteristics:
o high degree of dependence on family labor.
o profits accrue primarily to the farm/forest owner and their family.
o the farm/forest provides a primary source of income livelihood for the smallholder.
o production units have a relatively small land footprint (relative to the range of
production unit sizes for the given commodity and region).
o household resources are allocated to both food crops and cash crops.
o relatively low use of agricultural inputs and generally low productivity and yields.
o significant economic constraints, such as lack of capital assets and low access to
finance.
o significant information constraints, including lack of technical knowledge and low
access to market information (AFi, 2024).
• Third-party certification: when a certification process is carried out by an independent
organization.
• Tree plantations: a forest predominantly composed of trees established through planting
and/or deliberate seeding that lacks key elements of natural forest native to an area such as
species composition and structural diversity.
o Tree plantations generally have one or a few tree species and tend to include one or
more of the following characteristics (i) planted on cleared land, (ii) harvest regularly,
(iii) trees are of even ages, (iv) products from plantation are managed and processed
for commercial plantation.
o Tree plantations can consist of tree planted for timber, pulp, non-timber forest
products (e.g., rubber latex), or ecosystem services (e.g., soil stabilization). Plantation
dominantly by agricultural species (e.g., fruits or oil palm) are considered agriculture,
not tree plantations (AFi, 2019).

and other “natural ecosystems”, refer to the “Explanation of terms”.
Please explain (column 6)
• Provide further details on the land you own, manage and/or control that was not used to
produce your commodities in the reporting year.
• If you selected “Set aside land for conservation” in column 4 “Land type”, you can provide further
information on if this conservation is on a long-term basis and what type of conservation
designation or status is used there. If you have selected “Brazil” in column 1 “Country/area” then
the set aside land for conservation might be Areas of Permanent Protection (APPs) and Legal
Reserves, as defined by the Brazilian Forest Code.
• If you selected “Natural ecosystems with potential to be legally converted for commodity
production” in column 3 “Land type”, you can provide further details on the necessary permits
that you have obtained to expand for that commodity in the country/area (e.g. obtained a HGU
in Indonesia in the case of palm oil).
• Provide details on how the land is being managed effectively to retain its conservation values.
• Provide a description of how your future operation/expansion plans avoid deforestation and
conversion of natural ecosystems.
Explanation of • Area for infrastructure: areas used for mills, roads offices, etc. (SPOTT, 2017).
terms • Concession/lease: the right to use land or other property to produce commodities, granted by
a government, company, landholder, or a controlling body.
• Degraded/abandoned area with potential for commodity production: land owned/managed
by the company that is not used for commodity production due to degradation/abandonment,
but has the potential to produce commodities.
• Land managed by company-affiliated smallholders: land managed by smallholders with a
long-term or permanent selling relationship with a given buyer, that receive significant levels of
inputs, support, and/or requirements or mandates from that buyer (adapted from AFi, 2020).
• Natural ecosystem: an ecosystem that substantially resembles—in terms of species
composition, structure, and ecological function—one that is or would be found in a given area in
the absence of major human impacts. This includes human-managed ecosystems where much
of the natural species composition, structure, and ecological function are present (AFi, 2024).
• Natural forest: a forest that is a natural ecosystem, i.e., possesses most of the native species
composition, structure, and ecological function as a forest native to the given site. This
includes:
• Primary forests that have not been subject to major human impacts in recent history;
• Regenerated (second-growth) forests that were subject to major anthropogenic
impacts in the past (e.g., by agriculture, livestock raising, tree plantations, or intensive
logging) but where the main causes of impact have ceased or greatly diminished and
the ecosystem has attained much of the species composition, structure and ecological
function of prior or other contemporary natural ecosystems;
• Managed natural forests where much of the ecosystem composition, structure, and
ecological function exist in the presence of activities such as: (a) Harvesting of timber
or other forest products, including management to promote high-value species, (b) Low
intensity, small-scale cultivation within the forest, such as less-intensive forms of
swidden agriculture in a forest mosaic; and
• Forests that have been partially degraded by anthropogenic or natural causes (e.g.,
harvesting, fire, climate change, invasive species) but where the land has not been
converted to another use and where degradation does not result in the sustained
reduction of tree cover below the thresholds that define a forest or sustained loss of
31

other main elements of ecosystem composition, structure, and ecological function
(AFi, 2024).
• Set-aside land: land owned/managed by the company that is not used for production or
planned development and is set-aside for conservation purposes.

content • Provide a breakdown of your total palm oil derived biofuel volume that you produce and/or
source by country/area of origin and state/equivalent jurisdiction.
• If you have any volumes of unknown origin, you will be able to report it here.
Volume type (column 1)
• Provide your produced and sourced volumes separately by adding a new row.
Palm oil derived biofuel volume (column 2)
• If your organization both produces and sources biofuel derived from palm oil, add a row,
and provide the produced and sourced volumes in separate rows.
• Note: the sum of the volumes stated in all of the rows should equal your total palm oil
derived biofuel volume that you produce and/or source.
Metric (column 3)
• Ensure that you select a metric that is suitable to the forms of biofuel you are disclosing.
• If none of the available options are suitable, select “Other, please specify” and a text box will
appear for you to complete.
Country/area of origin (column 4)
• For each of your selected volume types in column 1, select the countries/areas of origin of
the palm oil used for biofuels. This information refers to the country/area in which the raw
material for your biofuels is grown or harvested, and not the location where it is processed
or turned into manufactured goods.
• Add a row for each country/area your palm oil derived biofuel volume originates from.
• Select “Unknown origin” if you do not know the country/area of origin associated with
some or all of your total palm oil derived biofuel volume.
First-level administrative division (column 5)
• This column appears if any option other than “Unknown origin” is selected in column 4
“Country/area of origin”.
• State the first-level administrative division within the country/area selected in column 4
“Country/area of origin” from which your produced or sourced palm oil derived biofuel
volume originates. For instance, this could be a federal state, a department, or a province
(e.g. the province of Jambi in Indonesia).
• If your palm oil derived biofuel volume originates from more than one state (or equivalent
jurisdiction) in the same country, add a row for each state.
37

• If your organization has no information on the state (or equivalent jurisdiction) where your
biofuel derived from palm oil came from, select “Unknown” and provide an explanation in
column 8 “Comment (optional)”.
• If your organization has the information but is not disclosing, select “Not disclosing” and
provide an explanation in column 8 “Comment (optional)”.
% of disclosure volume (column 6)
• Indicate the percentage of the “Disclosure volume” reported in 8.2, that is the
corresponding “Palm oil derived biofuel volume” stated in each row.
• Percentages smaller than 0.01% must be rounded up to 0.01% (the smaller value may be
provided in column 8 “Comment (optional)”).
Biofuel material is sourced from smallholders (column 7)
• This column appears if “Sourced” is selected in column 1 “Volume type”.
• Indicate whether the raw material that is used to make the biofuel derived from palm oil
used by your organization is sourced from smallholders.
Comment (optional) (column 8)
• If you select “Unknown” or "Not disclosing" in column 5 “State or equivalent jurisdiction”, or
“Unknown origin” in column 4 “Country/area of origin”, provide a brief explanation of why
this is the case.
• If you have had to round the percentage disclosed in column 6 “% of disclosure volume” up
to 0.01%, the smaller value may be disclosed here.
Explanation of • Disclosure volume: the volume that your organization includes in its disclosure. Organizations
terms are encouraged to report the “Total commodity volume” as their “Disclosure volume”, however
certain volumes may be excluded.
• Produced volume: the proportion of the "Disclosure volume" that is produced by your
organization e.g., commodities grown, reared or harvested on land owned, managed or
controlled.
• Smallholder: small-scale agricultural or forest products producers that are distinct from larger-
scale producers found in similar contexts by virtue of many or all of the following
characteristics:
o high degree of dependence on family labour
o profits accrue primarily to the farm’s or forest’s owner(s) and their family
o the farm or forest provides a primary source of livelihood for the smallholder
o production units have a relatively small land footprint (relative to the range of production
unit sizes for the given commodity and region)
o household resources are allocated to both food crops and cash crops
o relatively low use of agricultural inputs and generally low productivity and yields
o significant economic constraints, such as lack of capital assets and low access to finance
o significant information constraints, including lack of technical knowledge and low access
to market information (AFi, 2024).
• Sourced volume: the proportion of the "Disclosure volume" that is consumed, sourced,
purchased and/or used by your organization for processing, trading or used as an input for
manufacturing and/or packaging. This includes the commodity volume contained within
manufactured goods sold by retailers in addition to the volume of soy embedded in animal
products.

Requested Active no-deforestation or no-conversion target (column 1)
content • If you have set a target for achieving no deforestation or no conversion within the value chain of
your disclosed commodity, indicate this here.
• Select “Yes, we have a no-conversion target” if you have a comprehensive target to achieve no
deforestation and no conversion of other natural ecosystems such as savannahs, grasslands,
and peatlands. As such, a no-conversion target should also cover no deforestation, and there is
no need to report separate targets for no conversion and no deforestation.
• Select “Yes, we have a no-deforestation target” if you only have a target to achieve no
deforestation.
• If, for example, you have an organization-wide no-deforestation target but have set no-conversion
targets within specific countries/areas or biomes, select “Yes, we have a no-deforestation target”.
You will have the opportunity to provide details of where no-conversion targets apply in 8.7.1.
No-deforestation or no-conversion target coverage (column 2)
• This column is only presented if either “Yes, we have a no-conversion target” or “Yes, we have a
no-deforestation target” is selected in column 1 “Active no-deforestation or no-conversion
target”.
• Select “Organization-wide (including suppliers)” or “Organization-wide (direct operations only)” if
your target covers all operations within the selected boundary of your reporting boundary that
use the relevant commodity, even if the target itself does not extend to all areas of your business.
• If the target does not apply to the whole organization, select the option that best describes the
coverage of the target.
• If none of the available options describe your target coverage, select “Other, please specify” and
a text box will appear for you to complete.
• For guidance on country/area/regions, refer to the CDP technical note: Countries, Areas and
Regions.
Other active targets related to this commodity, including any which contribute to your no-deforestation or
no-conversion target (column 5)
• Select “Yes, we have other targets related to this commodity” if your organization has set any
targets other than a no-deforestation or no-conversion target requested in column 1. This
includes:
o Targets that contribute to implementing the no-deforestation or no-conversion targets
reported in column 1 (e.g., achieving 100% certification or traceability).
o Any other targets to achieve more sustainable production or sourcing of your disclosed
commodities.
Explain why you did not have an active no-deforestation or no conversion target in the reporting year
(column 4) or any other active target in the reporting year (column 7)
• Column 4 only appears if any “No…” option is selected in column 1 “Active no-deforestation or no-
conversion target”.
• Column 7 only appears if any “No…” option is selected in column 5 “Other active targets related
to this commodity, including any which contribute to your no-deforestation or no-conversion
target”.
• If you select “No, but we plan to…” in either column, specify, whenever possible:
o the type of target;
o progress indicators;
o whether it applies to produced or sourced commodities;
o the target coverage (e.g., organization-wide, or selected facilities); and
o the expected date for implementing the target.
• If you select “No, and we do not plan to…” in either column, provide further information to clarify
why you do not have targets and why you do not plan to have them in the next two years.

Explanation of • Conversion: loss of a natural ecosystem as a result of its replacement with agriculture or another
terms land use, or due to a profound and sustained change in a natural ecosystem’s species
composition, structure, or function.
o Deforestation is one form of conversion (conversion of natural forests).
o Conversion includes severe and sustained degradation or the introduction of
management practices that result in a profound and sustained change in the
ecosystem’s species composition, structure, or function.
o Change to natural ecosystems that meets this definition is considered to be
conversion regardless of whether or not it is legal (AFi, 2024).
• Deforestation: loss of natural forest as a result of: i) conversion to agriculture or other non-forest
land use; ii) conversion to a tree plantation; or iii) severe and sustained degradation.
o Severe and sustained degradation (scenario iii in the definition) constitutes
deforestation even if the land is not subsequently used for a non-forest land use.
o Loss of natural forest that meets this definition is considered to be deforestation
regardless of whether or not it is legal.
o The definition of deforestation signifies “gross deforestation” of natural forest where
“gross” is used in the sense of “total; aggregate; without deduction for reforestation or
other offset.” (adapted from AFi, 2024).
• Direct operations (also referred to as ‘own operations’): all activities and sites (e.g., buildings,
farms, mines, retail stores) over which the reporting organization has operational or financial
control. This covers any internal value chains between the organization’s business units
(adapted from TNFD, 2023; SBTN, 2023).
• No-conversion (also referred to as: deforestation- and conversion-free): commodity
production, sourcing, or financial investments that do not cause or contribute to the
conversion of natural ecosystems.
o No-conversion refers to no gross conversion of natural ecosystems, which the
Accountability Framework specifies as the appropriate policy and goal on this topic for
companies and supply chains.
o The terms “no-conversion” and “conversion-free” are used in favor of “zero-conversion”
because “zero” can imply an absolutist approach that may be at odds with the need to
sometimes accommodate minimal levels of conversion at the site level in the interest of
facilitating optimal conservation and production outcomes (see AFi’s definition for
minimal level [of deforestation or conversion], 2024) (adapted from AFi, 2024).
• No-deforestation (also referred to as: deforestation-free): commodity production, sourcing,
or financial investments that do not cause or contribute to deforestation.
o No-deforestation refers to no gross deforestation of natural forests, which the
Accountability Framework specifies as the appropriate policy and goal on this topic for
companies and supply chains.
o In the context of the Accountability Framework, deforestation refers to the loss of natural
forest (see definition of deforestation).
o The terms “no-deforestation” and “deforestation-free” are used in favor of “zero
deforestation” because “zero” can imply an absolutist approach that may be at odds with
the need sometimes to accommodate minimal levels of conversion at the site level in
the interest of facilitating optimal conservation and production outcomes (see AFi’s
definition for minimal level [of deforestation or conversion], 2024) (adapted from AFi,
2024).
• Supplier: an entity upstream from the reporting organization that provides or sells raw
materials, processed materials, finished products or services to the reporting organization
(adapted from GHG Protocol, 2013; ESRS, 2023).
43

• Target: a specific measurable output to be achieved within a specific timeline. Targets often
act as steps towards a wider and long-term corporate goal.

Requested General
content • This question requests additional information on the no-deforestation or no-conversion target
reported in 8.7.
• Responses to this question should be consistent with responses provided in 8.7 column 1 “Active
no-deforestation or no-conversion target” and column 3 “No-deforestation or no-conversion
target coverage”.
• If there is variability in certain elements of your target (e.g., you enforce different cut off dates for
different areas), add multiple rows to reflect this.
• Further details on targets can be provided in 8.7.2.
No-deforestation or no-conversion target (column 2)
• Since conversion includes deforestation, if you select “Yes, we have a no-conversion target” for
a commodity in column 1 of 8.7, you will only be presented with the option “No-conversion” in
this column.
• If you select “Yes, we have a no-deforestation target” for a commodity in 8.7, you will be presented
with both options “No-deforestation” and "No-conversion". This allows you to report a no-
conversion target for a specific biome, or country/area.
Your organization’s definition of “no-deforestation” or “no-conversion” (column 3)
• Provide the definition that your organization applies to its no-deforestation or no-conversion
targets.
• This may be the same as the definitions provided in “Explanation of terms”, or it may differ.
• Indicate if your definition relates to localized definitions for specific countries, commodities, or
other contexts.
• If you are defining “No-conversion”, indicate the land types covered by your target.
• If your definition is not representative of all the land types relevant to your organization, describe
your process for prioritizing the land types that are included.
• If you have assessed whether your no-deforestation or no-conversion definition is aligned with
the definitions provided by any recognized frameworks, initiatives, standards, agreements or
legislation (e.g., Accountability Framework), and found that your definition is aligned, indicate this
here.
• Refer to the AFi’s operational guidance on Applying the Definitions Related to Deforestation and
Conversion, for further information on applying definitions of ‘no-deforestation’ and ‘no-
conversion’ in relation to targets.
Cutoff date (column 4)
• Indicate the cutoff date after which deforestation or conversion of other natural ecosystems is
not accepted. Please refer to the section "Explanation of terms" for more details.
• If your target has multiple cutoff dates, add a row for each cutoff date.
• Select "No cutoff date" if none of your targets on no-deforestation or no-conversion specify a
cutoff date.
• For additional guidance on how organizations can select appropriate cutoff dates refer to the
AFi’s Operational Guidance on Cutoff Dates.
Geographic scope of cutoff date (column 5)
• This column only appears if any option except “No cutoff date” is selected in column 4 “Cutoff
date”.
• Select “Applied globally” only if you apply the same cutoff date regardless of where your activities
are located and do not apply different cutoff dates for some of the countries/areas you source
from.
47

• If you apply a cutoff date for specific countries/areas or biomes (e.g., the Amazon biome) select
either “Country/area, please specify” or “Biome, please specify”. Countries/areas or biomes may
be grouped if they share the same cutoff date and target.
Rationale for selecting cutoff date (column 6)
• This column only appears if any option except “No cutoff date” is selected in column 4 “Cutoff
date”.
• Select the option that best describes the primary reason why your organization selected its cutoff
date.
• Select “In line with organization commitments as no sector- or region-wide cutoff date is
available” or “In line with organization commitments but sector- or region-wide cutoff date is
available” if the cutoff date was determined internally for this specific target, and not based on
widely agreed upon and applied cutoff dates for a particular sector, commodity or region - either
because no relevant dates exist or you have chosen not to use them.
Target date for achieving no-deforestation or no-conversion (column 7)
• Select the year your organization specified for realizing its no-deforestation or no-conversion
target.
• If your organization has multiple target dates, add a row for each target date.
• If your organization’s target has no established date for achieving no-deforestation or no-
conversion, select "No target date".
Explanation of • Cutoff date: the date after which deforestation or conversion renders a given area or
terms production unit non-compliant with no-deforestation or no-conversion, commitments, policies,
goals, targets, or other obligations (AFi, 2024).

Requested General
content • This question requests information about your timebound and quantifiable targets that were
underway, achieved, expired, replaced, or retired during the reporting year.
• Targets reported here may contribute to implementing the no-deforestation or no-conversion
targets reported in 8.7 (e.g., achieving 100% certification or traceability).
• If you did not report a no-deforestation or no-conversion target, you may disclose any other
targets to achieve more sustainable production or sourcing of your disclosed commodities.
• If you failed to meet a target in the reporting year, report this, and do not report the same
target with a new date.
• To add targets, use the “Add Row” button. You may report up to 25 different targets.
• Your base year figure, reporting year figure, and target year figures may be numeric values or
percentages. Ensure the numeric type for these figures is consistent throughout each target.
For example, if you are using a percentage for the column 11 “Base year figure” you should
also provide a percentage in the column 13 “Target year figure” and column 14 “Reporting year
figure”.
• If you choose to report on your base, target and reporting year figures using a percentage, the
percentage for each should be equal to the amount of the selected metric during the
base/target/reporting year divided by the total amount of that specific metric. For example, if
your organization has a total of 50 direct suppliers and engaged with 20 of them during the
base year, then your base year figure should be 40%. Similarly, if your organization engaged
with 30 direct suppliers during the reporting year, then your reporting year figure should be
60%.
Target reference number (column 2)
• Select a “Target reference number” from the drop-down list to allocate a unique identifier to
your target. This will allow you to track and report progress for this target in future disclosures
to CDP until the target is retired. The target reference number is not specific to your
organization.
• When providing information from previously disclosed targets, be sure to use the same
reference number as in previous years. Targets should keep their reference number in
subsequent years. A target reference number may only apply to one single row.
Target contributes to no-deforestation or no-conversion target reported in 8.7 (column 3)
• This column only appears if you have selected “Yes, we have a no-deforestation target” or
“Yes, we have a no-conversion target” in response to column 1 “Active no-deforestation or no-
conversion target” in question 8.7.
• If the target you are disclosing on is in place to help your organization achieve its no-
deforestation or no-conversion target, indicate this here. For example, a target to improve the
traceability of a commodity within its supply chain could be in place to provide insight into
where conversion may be occurring, which can help to enforce preventative measures.
• If the target you are disclosing on is not in place to help your organization achieve its no-
deforestation or no-conversion target, indicate this here. For example, a target relating to
hectares of land area invested in under jurisdictional/landscape approach may refer solely to
land area that does not fall within commodity supply chains, and so would have no influence
on achieving no deforestation or no conversion within them.
Target coverage (column 4)
56

• Select “Organization-wide (direct operations only)”, if a target applies to your entire reporting
boundary, but is limited to your direct operations. Note that “Organization-wide” refers
collectively to all the companies, businesses, organizations, other entities or groups that fall
within your definition of the reporting boundary.
• If a target applies to both your direct operations and upstream value chain, select
“Organization-wide (including suppliers)".
• If the target does not apply to the whole organization, select the option that best describes the
coverage of the target.
o Select “Product level” if your target applies to specific products produced using the
disclosed commodity. For example, if you use cattle products for multiple products,
but are disclosing a target to achieve 100% third-party certification for car interior
specifically.
• If none of the available options describe your target coverage, select “Other, please specify”
and a text box will appear for you to complete.
Commodity volume covered by target (metric tons) (column 5)
• Select “Disclosure volume” if you selected either “Organization-wide” option in response to
column 4 “Target coverage”, and the target covers your disclosure volume disclosed in column
1 “Disclosure volume (metric tons)” of 8.2.
• Select “Total commodity volume” if you selected either “Organization-wide” option in response
to column 4 “Target coverage”, and the target covers your entire commodity volume disclosed
in column 5 “Total commodity volume (metric tons)” of 1.22.
• Select “Total commodity volume associated with operations or locations covered by target” if
you selected any option except either “Organization-wide” option in response to column 4
“Target coverage”, and the target covers the entire volume associated with your selected
target coverage.
• If none of the available options reflect the commodity volume covered by the target, select
“Other volume, please specify” and disclose the commodity volume the target applies to in
metric tons.
Category of target & quantitative metric (column 6)
• Note that some target categories listed in this column correspond to questions you will find in
different sections of the Environmental Performance - Forests module (Module 8). For greater
clarity on terminology and different actions to achieve specific targets, refer to the guidance to
these individual questions.
• If your target is related to “Traceability”, provide further details on the level of traceability
across your value chain in column 7 “Traceability point”.
• If your target is linked to “Third-party certification”, provide further details on which schemes
are accepted in column 8 “Third-party certification scheme”.
• If disclosing on a “% of volume” metric, the percentage should be of the volume figure
indicated in column 5 “Commodity volume covered by target (metric tons)”.
• If disclosing on a metric that is framed as a percentage reduction, you will need to reframe the
metric in columns 11 “Base year figure”, 13 “Target year figure” and 14 “Reporting year figure”
so that is presented as a percentage increase. This applies to the following metrics:
o % decrease in absolute agricultural land footprint from direct operations
o % decrease in agricultural land footprint intensity from direct operations
o % of commodity volume discarded as waste
o % decrease in average weight of packaging per product unit (grams)
o % decrease in material inputs for paper and packaging products (%)
57

• For example, when disclosing using the metric “% of commodity volume discarded as waste”
– if 40% of a commodity volume is being discarded as waste, and the target is to bring this
down to 0%, this would be presented as 60% of the commodity volume is currently not
discarded as waste in column 11, and the target would be to achieve 100% not discarded as
waste in column 13.
Third-party certification scheme (column 8)
• This column only appears if you selected “Third-party certification” in response to column 6
“Category of target”.
• If you have a target that involves more than one certification scheme per commodity,
select all that apply.
• If none of the available options describe the scheme adopted by your organization, or if you
would like to add a scheme that is not on the list, select “Other, please specify” and a text
box will appear for you to complete.
Date target was set (column 9)
• Enter the date in which your organization set the target.
• This must be either before or during the reporting year but cannot be after the reporting
year or after the end date of target year.
• If you have a year-on-year rolling target or a maintenance target, enter the year you first set
the target. This can be before the base year.
• If you set the target based on financial years, enter the year that applies to the end of your
financial year.
• If you do not know the exact date on which your company set the target, enter the end of
the year that the target was set.
End date of base year (column 10)
• The base year is the year against which you are comparing your target. For example, if the
target is to increase tier 1 supplier engagement by 20% based on the percentage of
suppliers engaged in 2020, the end date of the base year is 31st December 2020.
• The base year cannot be after your reporting year.
• If you have a year-on-year rolling target or a maintenance target, the base year will be the
previous reporting year.
• If you set the target based on financial years, enter the year that applies to the end of your
financial year.
• If you have a target based on an average over a period of time (e.g., 5-year average), enter
the year that applies to the end of the average period.
Base year figure (column 11)
• Provide the base year figure for your target. This is the figure against which progress is
measured. It may be an absolute value or a percentage value.
• This figure will be used to auto-calculate the “% of target achieved relative to base year” in
column 16.
End date of target (column 12)
• This date represents when you expect to achieve your target.
58

• Enter the date year that the target ends. For example, if the target is to increase tier 1
supplier engagement by 20% by the end of 2025, the end date of the target is 31st
December 2025.
• If you have a year-on-year rolling target or maintenance target, the target year will be the
reporting year.
• If you have a target based on financial years, enter the end date of the year that applies to
the end of your financial year.
• You should not report any target that was completed before the start of the reporting year.
Target year figure (column 13)
• Enter the figure that you are aiming to achieve in the target year. This may be a numeric
value or a percentage.
• This should not represent the metric’s percent increase, but the targeted figure for the
metric in the unit used to monitor it.
• If you are disclosing on a maintenance target, this should be the same as your base year
figure.
• This figure will be used to auto-calculate the “% of target achieved relative to base year” in
column 16.
Reporting year figure (column 14)
• Enter the figure achieved in the reporting year. This may be a numeric value or a
percentage.
• Ensure the figure reported is consistent with your response to column 5 “Commodity
volume covered by target (metric tons)”.
• This figure will be used to auto-calculate the “% of target achieved relative to base year” in
column 16.
Target status in reporting year (column 15)
• New - Select this option for targets that have been set in the reporting year and are still in
progress.
• Underway - Select this option for targets that were set before the reporting year, with an
end date in the future, that have not been achieved and continue to be pursued.
• Achieved - Select this option for targets that are in place to achieve a certain level of
performance (e.g., to achieve 100% compliance with a commitment to no conversion for
the volume sourced from direct suppliers) and have been achieved or exceeded in the
reporting year.
• Achieved and maintained – Select this option for targets that are in place to maintain a
certain level of performance (e.g., to maintain 100% compliance with a commitment to no
conversion for the volume sourced from Tier 1 suppliers) and this has been achieved in the
reporting year.
• Expired - Select this option for targets with an end date within the reporting year, that have
not been achieved or maintained and have therefore expired in the reporting year.
• Revised - Select this option for targets that were set before the reporting year but a
revision has been made to any of the elements in columns 4 to 14 in the reporting year, for
example due to a recalculation of the base year figure or a change to the end date of the
target.
59

• Replaced - Select this option for previously reported targets that have been replaced with
another target in the reporting year, for example where a facility target has been
incorporated into an organization-wide target.
• Retired - Select this option for targets with an end date in the future, that have not been
achieved, but will no longer be pursued.
% of target achieved relative to base year [auto-calculated] (column 16)
• This column only appears if you have selected any option except “Achieved and
maintained” in response to column 15 “Target status in reporting year”.
• This column will be auto-calculated.
• The % of target achieved relative to the base year will be calculated using the base year
figure (column 11), the target year figure (column 13) and the reporting year figure (column
14). Ensure that you have entered data into these columns.
o
Reporting year figure (column 14) – Base year figure (column 11)
×100
Target year figure (column 13) – Base year figure (column 11)
• For example, if you are disclosing on soy and you selected “Percentage of volume third-
party certified” as your metric, and your base year figure is 65%, your reporting year figure
is 90% and your target year figure is 100% this column will display 71%.
• Negative values indicate a setback in your target progress relative to the base year.
• Values greater than 100 indicate that you have exceeded your target.
Global environmental treaties/initiatives/frameworks aligned with or supported by this target (column 17)
• Select any of the global environmental treaties/initiatives/frameworks for which you have
assessed that achieving the target you are disclosing will contribute to your organization
aligning with or supporting the goals of them.
• If you have assessed this but found no alignment, select “None, no alignment after
assessment”.
• If you have not assessed this, select “None, alignment not assessed”.
• If you have assessed alignment with any other global environmental
treaties/initiatives/frameworks, select “Other, please specify” and provide a label to indicate
which global environmental treaties/initiatives/frameworks are aligned.
Explain target coverage and identify any exclusions (column 18)
• If the target is not organization-wide (i.e., it does not apply to the whole organization in line
with your definition of the reporting boundary), provide further details of your target
coverage in this column. E.g. if you have selected “Country/area/region” in column 4, please
specify which countries/areas/regions your target covers.
• If you selected “Other volume, please specify” in column 5 “Commodity volume covered by
target (metric tons)”, indicate if you have excluded any relevant volumes from your target.
o State the reason for omitting these volumes and outline any steps you are taking to
enable target-setting for relevant volumes.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year (column 19)
• This column only appears if you select “Underway”, “Revised”, or “New” in column 15
“Target status in reporting year”.
• If you are not on track to achieve the target, explain how you plan to get back on track.
• If possible, specify your anticipated and/or observed progress curve in this column, i.e.:
o Linear – the rate of progress towards the target is anticipated and/or observed to
be steady over time
60

o Logarithmic – the rate of progress towards the target is anticipated and/or
observed to be faster at the start
o Exponential – the rate of progress towards the target is anticipated and/or
observed to be faster at the end
o Variable – the rate of progress towards the target is anticipated and/or observed to
change from year to year
List the actions which contributed most to achieving or maintaining this target (column 20)
• This column is only presented if “Achieved” is selected in column 15 “Target status in
reporting year” OR “Achieved and maintained” is selected in column 15 “Target status in
reporting year” AND column 11 “Base year figure” is equal to column 14 “Reporting year
figure”.
• If you have achieved your target in this reporting year, indicate the key actions your
organization took to achieve the target.
• If your target was to maintain a certain level of performance in the reporting year, and your
organization was successful in doing so, indicate the key actions taken to maintain the
target.
Further details of target (column 21)
• Use this column to provide any further details or context that may be relevant for
understanding this target.
• If you are disclosing a maintenance target and you have not been able to maintain your
reported base year figure in the reporting year, explain why this was the case.
• You can use this column to identify whether you have a financial year or average year-
based target.
• If your target was originally in a different format, you may wish to give the original target
before it was converted into the format required for the purposes of this table.
• If your target is part of a wider goal, a regulatory requirement, or a longer-term target, you
can also explain this here.
• If relevant, explain how this target intends to help your organization manage its forests-
related dependencies, impacts, risks and/or opportunities.
• Provide details of the methodology used to set the target and baseline, including whether
you have used any external standards when setting the target and whether these use a
science-based approach.
Explanation of • Afforestation: establishment of forest through planting and/or deliberate seeding on land
terms that, until then, was not classified as forest, which implies a transformation of land use
from non-forest to forest (FAO, 2015).
• Certification: the action or process of providing a product with an official document
attesting to a status or level of achievement against a certain standard.
• Deforestation-free (also referred to as “no-deforestation”): commodity production,
sourcing, or financial investments that do not cause or contribute to deforestation.
o Deforestation-free refers to no gross deforestation of natural forests, which the
Accountability Framework specifies as the appropriate policy and goal on this
topic for companies and supply chains.
o In the context of the Accountability Framework, deforestation refers to the loss of
natural forest (see definition of deforestation).
o The terms “no-deforestation” and “deforestation-free” are used in favor of “zero
deforestation” because “zero” can imply an absolutist approach that may be at
odds with the need sometimes to accommodate minimal levels of conversion at
61

the site level in the interest of facilitating optimal conservation and production
outcomes (see AFi’s definition for minimal level [of deforestation or conversion],
2024) (adapted from AFi, 2024).
• Deforestation- and conversion-free (also referred to as "no-conversion"): commodity
production, sourcing, or financial investments that do not cause or contribute to
deforestation and the conversion of natural ecosystems.
o Conversion-free refers to no gross conversion of natural ecosystems, which the
Accountability Framework specifies as the appropriate policy and goal on this
topic for companies and supply chains.
o Deforestation-free refers to no gross deforestation of natural forests, which the
Accountability Framework specifies as the appropriate policy and goal on this
topic for companies and supply chains.
o In the context of the Accountability Framework, deforestation refers to the loss of
natural forest (see definition of deforestation).
o The terms “no-conversion”, and “deforestation- and conversion-free” are used in
favor of “zero-conversion” because “zero” can imply an absolutist approach that
may be at odds with the need to sometimes accommodate minimal levels of
conversion at the site level in the interest of facilitating optimal conservation and
production outcomes (see AFi’s definition for minimal level [of deforestation or
conversion], 2024) (adapted from AFi, 2024).
• Landscape and jurisdictional approach: a muti-stakeholder collaborative strategy to
advance shared sustainability goals and build resilience at landscape scale. A jurisdictional
approach is a landscape approach defined by administrative boundaries and with high level
of government involvement.
• Landscape and jurisdictional initiatives: the on-the-ground collaborative program to set
common goals, take collective action while reconciling different interest, and monitor
progress towards improving social, environmental, and economic outcomes at
landscape/jurisdictional scale.
• Reforestation: re-establishment of forest through planting and/or deliberate seeding on
land classified as forest (FAO, 2015).
• Restoration: the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem, and its associated
conservation values, that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed (adapted from SER,
2004).
• Smallholder: small-scale agricultural or forest products producers that are distinct from
larger-scale producers found in similar contexts by virtue of many or all of the following
characteristics:
o high degree of dependence on family labor.
o profits accrue primarily to the farm/forest owner and their family.
o the farm/forest provides a primary source of income livelihood for the smallholder.
o production units have a relatively small land footprint (relative to the range of production
unit sizes for the given commodity and region).
o household resources are allocated to both food crops and cash crops.
o relatively low use of agricultural inputs and generally low productivity and yields.
o significant economic constraints, such as lack of capital assets and low access to
finance.
o significant information constraints, including lack of technical knowledge and low
access to market information (adapted from AFi, 2024).
• Third-party certification: when a certification process is carried out by an independent
organization.
• Tier 1 supplier (also referred to as ‘direct supplier’): a supplier that provides or sells
products directly to the reporting organization (GHG Protocol, 2013).
62

• Tier 2, 3, or 4+ supplier: a supplier that provides or sells products to the suppliers of the
reporting organization (GHG Protocol, 2013).
• Traceability: the ability to follow a product or its components through stages of the
upstream value chain (e.g., production, processing, manufacturing, and distribution)
(adapted from AFi, 2024).
• Year-on-year rolling target: targets with a set goal to achieve on a yearly basis. An example
of this would be a target to replace revenue from beef with alternative sources by 2% each
year.

Rationale Organizations should know or control the origins of their sourced commodities to eliminate
deforestation and conversion of other natural ecosystems in their value chain. Robust
traceability systems allow organizations to ascertain that the production and processing units of
commodity origins are free from deforestation and conversion. This information helps investors
and other data users assess whether organizations have the necessary traceability systems to
determine the compliance of sourced volumes with their no-deforestation and no-conversion
policies, targets, and goals, and the methodologies and tools involved.
Ambition Organizations have robust traceability systems in place to ensure the origins of the sourced
volumes across their value chain are known or controlled to a sufficient extent to determine the
deforestation- and conversion-free status of production and processing units.

General
content
• This question gathers information on the traceability systems your organization uses to
know or control the origins of its sourced volumes.
• If you use your suppliers’ traceability systems, you may select “Yes” in response to column
1 "Traceability system” and provide details on these systems.
• Depending on your position in the value chain, the approach to tracing your sourced
volumes may vary i.e.,
o Primary processors and first intermediary traders: should know the origin of raw
materials to the level of the production unit.
o Buyers downstream of the first intermediary (e.g., manufacturers and retailers)
should trace supplies upstream until they can ascertain compliance status at the
supply base level, through evidence from suppliers.
• Buyers at any stage of the value chain should use one or more of the following methods to
determine the deforestation- and conversion-free status of the production and processing
units of origin:
o trace materials back to the production or processing units of origin.
o trace materials back to an intermediate supplier that itself has effective control
mechanisms in place to ensure that its supplies are traced to the production or
processing units of origin and can provide sufficient evidence of this to the buyer.
o utilize credible assurance systems (e.g., credible certification systems) capable of
linking raw material supplies with production units having specific compliance or
performance attributes.
64

o trace materials to jurisdictions or landscapes where it has been demonstrated that
performance related to specific social or environmental issues is adequate to fulfil the
buyer’s commitments on the corresponding issues.
Traceability system (column 1)
• Select “Yes” if your organization has a system in place to determine the origins of its
sourced volumes. Systems can include:
o business-to-business disclosure of traceability information from suppliers
o internal systems
o third-party certification
o use of open data platforms, e.g., TRASE, to link purchases to production regions for
different commodities
Description of methods/tools used in traceability system (column 3)
• This column only appears if “Yes” is selected in column 1 “Traceability system”.
• Provide further details on the methods/tools you selected in column 2 “Methods/tools used
in traceability system”. For example, if you selected “Internal traceability system”, provide
details on the type of systems used.
• You may provide details on how the methods/tools differ based on the form of
commodities that you source or use.
Explain why your organization does not have a traceability system (column 5)
• This column only appears if you select either “No…” option in column 1 “Traceability system”.
• Briefly describe the primary reason selected in column 4 “Primary reason your organization
does not have a traceability system” and explain any plans to address this in the future.
Explanation of • Sourced volume: the proportion of the "Disclosure volume" that is consumed, sourced,
terms purchased and/or used by your organization for processing, trading or used as an input for
manufacturing and/or packaging. This includes the commodity volume contained within
manufactured goods sold by retailers in addition to the volume of soy embedded in animal
products.
• Traceability: the ability to follow a product or its components through stages of the

(adapted from AFi, 2024).
• Traceability system: a system that records and follows the trail of products and/or raw
materials along the value chain as they move from suppliers and are processed and
ultimately distributed as end products. Systems used to ensure traceability can be
digital/electronic or manual/paper based (ISEAL, 2016).

Rationale Organizations must understand and disclose the traceability levels of their sourced volumes to
demonstrate their ability to assess compliance with no-deforestation and no-conversion policies,
targets, and goals. This question helps investors and other data users understand the extent to
which organizations know the origin of their commodities, and therefore their ability to determine
deforestation- and conversion-free (DCF) status and identify their dependencies, impacts, risks,
and opportunities.
Ambition Organizations trace their sourced volumes back to a point from which they can confirm that no
deforestation and no conversion of other natural ecosystems occurred during production, after a
designated cutoff date.

• This question requests a percentage breakdown of your sourced volume by the level of
traceability, and the percentage from an unknown origin. The percentages reported across
66

columns 1 “% […] traceable to production unit” to 5 “% […] from unknown origin” should account
for 100% of the sourced volume you reported in 8.2, for each commodity.
• If you have included embedded soy in your sourced volume, as reported in 8.2 and 8.2.1, you
should include your embedded soy volume in your response to this question.
• Note: when disclosing the traceability of embedded soy, report the level of traceability back to
the soy production origin. If you can only trace to the origin of the animal that was fed the soy
or to the soy feed supplier origin, report this in column “% of sourced volume traceable to other
point…”. If you have not traced your embedded soy at all, disclose this in column “% of sourced
volume from unknown origin”.

• If you have traced your sourced volumes to the specific production unit of origin (e.g. farm,
breeding farm, plantation, ranch, or forest management unit), report the related percentage
here.
% of sourced volume traceable to sourcing area and not to production unit (column 2)
• If you have traced your sourced volumes to an area or region where the material was produced
or extracted (e.g., a radius or supply shed around a mill, processing facility or a first point of
collection), but the specific production unit of origin is not known, report the related percentage
here.

(column 3)
• If you have not traced your sourced volume to the production unit or sourcing area where the
material was produced and have only traced to the level of the country/area of origin, report the
related percentage here. For further guidance on country/area lists, refer to the CDP technical
note: Countries, Areas and Regions.

country to the country/area of origin, report the related percentage here.
% of sourced volume reported [auto calculated] (column 6)
• This column will be auto-calculated. The percentage of sourced volume reported will be
calculated as the sum of column 1 “% […] traceable to production unit”, column 2 “% […]
traceable to sourcing area and not to production unit, column 3 “% […] traceable to country/area
of origin and not to sourcing area or production unit”, column 4 “% […] traceable to other point
(i.e., processing facility/first importer) not in the country/area of origin” and column 5 “% […]
from unknown origin”. Ensure that you have entered data into all these columns. If none of
your volumes are traceable to a particular point, enter 0 (zero). These columns should be
completed for all commodity rows.
• Please ensure that this column adds up to 100%.
Explanation of • Production unit: a plantation, farm, ranch, or forest management unit. This includes all plots
terms used for agriculture or forestry that are under one management, located in the same general
area, and share the same means of production. It also includes natural ecosystems,
infrastructure, and other land within or associated with the plantation, farm, ranch, or forest
management unit.
67

o A production unit can be a contiguous land area (regardless of any internal
subdivisions) or a group of plots interspersed with other land units the same area or
landscape and under the same management (AFi, 2024).
• Sourcing area: an area or region from which materials in a supply chain originate.
o Sourcing areas could include a sourcing radius or a supply-shed around a first point of
collection or processing facility (e.g., a radius from a palm oil mill); a defined production
landscape set of production units supplying a particular aggregator or buyer (e.g. the
area covered by a smallholder cooperative); or a landscape or subnational jurisdiction
(e.g. municipality) from which materials are sourced (AFi, 2024).
Example response Example of an organization that has:
• 50% of their palm oil traceable to the plantation where it was produced, in Argentina (i.e.
production unit).
• 20% traceable to a processing facility close to the plantation where it was produced, in
Argentina (i.e. sourcing area).
• 10% only traceable to Argentina, but not to a specific processing facility or plantation (i.e.
country/area of origin).
• 10% traceable to a first importer in Paraguay, not to the country/area of origin that the palm oil
was produced in (i.e. traceable to other point).
• 10% from an origin that is unknown (i.e. unknown origin).

Deforestation- and- conversion free (DCF) status metrics and methods to determine DCF
Section This section gathers information on the proportion of volumes in an organization’s direct
Overview operations and upstream value chain that are assessed and determined to be deforestation-
free (DF) or deforestation- and conversion-free (DCF). The DF or DCF designation signifies
that the production and sourcing of commodity volumes did not cause or contribute to
deforestation and conversion since a specified cutoff date. Responses to this section should
align with your organization’s commitments/ targets on no deforestation and no conversion
disclosed in 8.7.1.
This section will request further information on the methods used to determine the DF/DCF
status of disclosure volume. The DF/DCF status may be assessed via any of these three
methods:
o Certification through schemes providing full DF/DCF assurance
o Production unit level monitoring
o Sourcing area level monitoring
(8.9) Provide details of your organization's assessment of the deforestation-free (DF) or deforestation- and
conversion-free (DCF) status of its disclosed commodities.

Rationale Organizations should disclose the proportion of volumes in their direct operations and upstream
value chain assessed and determined to be DF or DCF. The DF designation signifies that the
production and sourcing of commodity volumes did not cause or contribute to deforestation
since a specified cutoff date, while the DCF designation signifies that the production and
sourcing of commodity volumes did not cause or contribute to deforestation and the conversion
of other natural ecosystems since a specified cutoff date. This question helps data users
understand organizations’ performance and progress towards DCF and the methods used to
ascertain DF/DCF status.
Ambition • Organizations track progress towards achieving DF or DCF.
• Organizations disclose on their progress to achieving DF or DCF and disclose relevant
methodological choices used to calculate DF/DCF volumes.
• Organizations disclose on their progress to achieving DF/DCF by methods.
• Organizations have assessed 100% of their volumes to be deforestation and conversion free
since cutoff date.

• This question requests a breakdown of the methods used to determine the DF/DCF status
of your disclosure volume in the reporting year.
• If you have used multiple methods to assure the DF/DCF status of the same commodity
volume, report all the methods used. Refer to the example responses in the CDP technical
note ‘Reporting progress on Deforestation- and Conversion-free value chains’ for further
guidance on reporting multiple methods of assurance.
• The cutoff date stated in 8.7.1 (targets) provides the basis for calculating your DF/DCF
volumes. For example, if you report a 2020 cutoff date for a timber no-conversion target in
8.7.1, the percentage of your timber disclosure volume reported as DCF in 8.9 must
originate from production units free from deforestation and conversion since 2020.Ensure
that your response here is consistent with the type of target you have selected in 8.7.1
for the disclosed commodity. For example, select “Yes, deforestation- and conversion-free
(DCF)”, if you:
• Reported in 8.7.1 that you have a no-conversion target; and
• Have assessed for no conversion of forests and other natural ecosystems since the stated
cutoff-date.
• The DCF status of commodity volumes may be assessed via any of these three methods:
o Certification through schemes providing full DF/DCF assurance
o Production unit level monitoring
o Sourcing area level monitoring
• Do not report volumes certified through schemes that do not provide full DF/DCF
assurance in column 3 “% of disclosure volume determined as DF/DCF through a scheme
providing full DF/DCF assurance”.
• For the full list of certifications included in the CDP forest module see the CDP technical note
‘Reporting progress on Deforestation- and Conversion-free value chains’.
•
DF/DCF status assessed for this commodity (column 1)
• Select “Yes, deforestation-free (DF) status assessed” if your organization has assessed
whether commodity volumes have contributed to deforestation. In this case, your
responses to 8.9.1/8.9.3/8.9.4 will relate to methods to determine DF status.
• Select “Yes, deforestation- and conversion-free (DCF) status assessed” if your assessment
includes conversion of other natural ecosystems. In this case your responses to
8.9.1/8.9.3/8.9.4 will relate to methods to determine DCF status.
% of disclosure volume determined as DF/DCF through a third-party certification scheme providing full
DF/DCF assurance (column 3)
• This column only appears if “Yes, deforestation- and conversion-free (DCF) status
assessed” or “Yes, deforestation-free (DF) status assessed” in column 1 “DF/DCF status
assessed for this commodity”.
• If you report a percentage higher than 0% in this column, you will be asked to provide
further details on how you have determined volumes as DF/DCF through this method, in
the following questions.
• Volumes reported as "determined as DF/DCF through a scheme providing full DF/DCF
assurance" should be:
• Certified through an accredited scheme, with criteria that prohibit deforestation and
conversion after a stated cutoff date; and/or
• Certified through a scheme using a chain-of-custody model that verifies the physical
traceability of raw material supplies to a production unit that complies with no-
deforestation or no-conversion criteria.
73

• Note: segregated and identity-preserved mechanisms meet this criterion, while mass
balance, mixed, and crediting systems generally do not. Refer to the “Explanations of
terms” section below for further details on schemes providing full assurance.
• When using a certification scheme to demonstrate DF/DCF, buyers should exercise due
diligence to ascertain that both the requirements and the implementation of the
certification scheme are sufficiently robust to provide a high level of assurance regarding
DF/DCF status.
% of disclosure volume determined as DF/DCF through monitoring of production unit (column 4)
• This column only appears if “Yes, deforestation- and conversion-free (DCF) status
assessed” or “Yes, deforestation-free (DF) status assessed” in column 1 “DF/DCF status
assessed for this commodity”.
• If you report a percentage higher than 0% in this column, you will be asked to provide
further details on how you have determined volumes as DF/DCF through this method, in
the following questions.
• If you know the boundaries of the production units in your own operations or from which
you source, the DF/DCF status of volumes can be assessed directly by determining
whether there has been deforestation or conversion on each production unit after the
relevant cutoff date.
• Downstream organizations (i.e., buyers) can also collect this information from their
suppliers via business-to-business value chain control systems, which can decrease the
monitoring burden on downstream organizations.
• Note: buyers must ensure that information is reliable, which may require independent
verification.
% of disclosure volume determined as DF/DCF through monitoring of sourcing area (column 5)
• This column only appears if “Yes, deforestation- and conversion-free (DCF) status
assessed” or “Yes, deforestation-free (DF) status assessed” in column 1 “DF/DCF status
assessed for this commodity”.
• If you report a percentage higher than 0% in this column, you will be asked to provide
further details on how you have determined volumes as DF/DCF through this method, in
the following questions.
• If you can trace materials to a sourcing area with no or negligible deforestation or
conversion since an appropriate cutoff date, volumes sourced from that area may be
considered DF/DCF.
• If using this approach, you must continue to monitor the sourcing areas to identify any
change in the occurrence or risk of deforestation or conversion.
• Risk assessments should use clear and well-defined metrics to evaluate the risks
objectively. The methods used should be credible and current and provide all the data
necessary to effectively characterize the risk (Adapted from AFi, 2020).
Is a proportion of your disclosure volume certified through a scheme not providing full DF/DCF
assurance? (column 6)
• If you select “Yes” you will be able to provide details of certifications you are using that do
not provide full DF/DCF assurance and the additional control methods, in the following
questions.
• Refer to the “Explanation of terms” section, and the response options in 8.9.2 for further
information on which are schemes are not considered to provide full DF/DCF assurance.
Explain why you have not assessed DF/DCF status (column 8)

• This column only appears if you select either “No…” option in column 1 “DF/DCF status
assessed for this commodity”.
• Briefly describe the primary reason selected in column 7 “Primary reason for not assessing
DF/DCF status” and explain any plans to address this in the future.
Explanation of • Certification schemes providing full DCF assurance: include robust requirements on no
terms deforestation and no conversion, after an appropriate cutoff date, and/or physical
traceability of raw material supplies back to a production unit that complies with specific
performance attributes, i.e., free from deforestation and conversion.
• Conversion: loss of a natural ecosystem as a result of its replacement with agriculture or
another land use, or due to a profound and sustained change in a natural ecosystem’s
species composition, structure, or function.
o Deforestation is one form of conversion (conversion of natural forests).
o Conversion includes severe and sustained degradation or the introduction of
management practices that result in a profound and sustained change in the
ecosystem’s species composition, structure, or function.
o Change to natural ecosystems that meets this definition is considered to be
conversion regardless of whether or not it is legal (AFi, 2024).
• Control system: a system for assessing and managing the attributes of raw materials or
products at their place of production and/or as they move through a supply chain (adapted
from AFi, 2024).
• Cutoff date: the date after which deforestation or conversion renders a given area or
production unit non-compliant with no-deforestation or no-conversion, commitments,
policies, goals, targets, or other obligations (AFi, 2024).
• Deforestation: loss of natural forest as a result of: i) conversion to agriculture or other non-
forest land use; ii) conversion to a tree plantation; or iii) severe and sustained degradation
o Severe and sustained degradation (scenario iii in the definition) constitutes
deforestation even if the land is not subsequently used for a non-forest land use.
o Loss of natural forest that meets this definition is considered to be deforestation
regardless of whether or not it is legal.
o The definition of deforestation signifies “gross deforestation” of natural forest
where “gross” is used in the sense of “total; aggregate; without deduction for
reforestation or other offset.” (adapted from AFi, 2024).
• Deforestation-free (also referred to as: no-deforestation): commodity production, sourcing,
or financial investments that do not cause or contribute to deforestation.
o Deforestation-free refers to no gross deforestation of natural forests, which the
Accountability Framework specifies as the appropriate policy and goal on this
topic for companies and supply chains.
o In the context of the Accountability Framework, deforestation refers to the loss of
natural forest (see definition of deforestation).
o The terms “no-deforestation” and “deforestation-free” are used in favor of “zero
deforestation” because “zero” can imply an absolutist approach that may be at
odds with the need sometimes to accommodate minimal levels of conversion at
the site level in the interest of facilitating optimal conservation and production
outcomes (see AFi’s definition for minimal level [of deforestation or conversion],
2024) (adapted from AFi, 2024).
• Deforestation- and conversion-free (also referred to as "no-conversion"): commodity
production, sourcing, or financial investments that do not cause or contribute to
deforestation and the conversion of natural ecosystems.
o Conversion-free refers to no gross conversion of natural ecosystems, which the
Accountability Framework specifies as the appropriate policy and goal on this
topic for companies and supply chains.
75

o Deforestation-free refers to no gross deforestation of natural forests, which the

conversion at the site level in the interest of facilitating optimal conservation and
production outcomes (see AFi’s definition for minimal level [of deforestation or
conversion], 2024) (adapted from AFi, 2024).
• Disclosure volume: the volume that your organization includes in its disclosure.
Organizations are encouraged to report the “Total commodity volume” as their “Disclosure
volume”, however certain volumes may be excluded.
• Negligible risk: a conclusion, based on credible evidence, that it is exceedingly unlikely that
material produced in or sourced from a given context is non-compliant with one or more
aspects of a company’s social and environmental commitments, policies, or other
obligations.
o Criteria for determining negligible risk should be defined in each sourcing area and
for each aspect of a company’s social and environmental commitments, policies,
and other obligations. A given production area could be considered negligible risk
for one aspect of a company’s social and environmental obligations but not
negligible risk for other aspects (adapted from AFi, 2024).
• Production unit: a plantation, farm, ranch, or forest management unit. This includes all
plots used for agriculture or forestry that are under one management, located in the same
general area, and share the same means of production. It also includes natural
ecosystems, infrastructure, and other land within or associated with the plantation, farm,
ranch, or forest management unit.
o A production unit can be a contiguous land area (regardless of any internal
subdivisions) or a group of plots interspersed with other land units the same area
or landscape and under the same management (AFi, 2024).
• Sourcing area: an area or region from which materials in a supply chain originate.
o Sourcing areas could include a sourcing radius or a supply-shed around a first
point of collection or processing facility (e.g., a radius from a palm oil mill); a
defined set of production units supplying a particular aggregator or buyer (e.g. the
area covered by a smallholder cooperative); or a landscape or subnational
jurisdiction (e.g. municipality) from which materials are sourced (AFi, 2024).

• Chain-of-custody model (alternatively referred to as “control system”, “traceability type”, or
“supply chain models”): the process by which materials and associated information are
transferred, monitored, and controlled as they move through each step in a value chain.
Commonly recognized types of chain-of-custody models are as follows:
o Identity preserved: a chain-of-custody model under which materials with particular
characteristics that originate from a single identifiable certified source are kept separate
from all other sources throughout the value chain.
o Segregated: a chain-of-custody model under which materials with particular
characteristics that are kept separate from materials that may lack these characteristics,
although materials are not necessarily traced and controlled back to a single identifiable
source and may be mixed from among multiple sources.
o Mass balance (synonym: mixed): a chain-of-custody model under which product with
particular characteristics is not separated from and may be mixed with product that lacks
these characteristics at any stage in the value chain, provided that the quantities are
controlled such that the quantity of product sold as having the given characteristics is
equivalent to the quantity of product produced with these characteristics (adapted from

• When the organization knows the boundaries of production units in its own operations or from
which it sources, DF/DCF volumes may be assessed directly by determining whether there has
been deforestation or conversion on each production unit after the relevant cutoff date. This
information may also be passed from suppliers to buyers via business-to-business value chain
control mechanisms. Where suppliers are able to provide reliable data to their buyers regarding
the DF/DCF status of volumes that they are supplying, based on site-level assessment, this
may greatly decrease the monitoring burden on downstream companies. However, it is
incumbent upon buyers to ensure that any such information is reliable.
• The origin of commodities must first be traced to production units before monitoring of
production units becomes a viable means of determining if volumes are DF/DCF. This question
therefore only applies to the volumes reported in column “% of sourced volume traceable to
production unit” in 8.8.1.
• The monitoring of the production unit should cover all deforestation and/or conversion in the
production unit since the cutoff date, regardless of the current use of the land.

which this monitoring has occurred, e.g., birth farm, rearing farm, fattening farm.
DF/DCF status verified (column 4)
• For volumes determined to be DF/DCF through production unit monitoring, indicate if this
status has been verified. Verification is a separate process, conducted by an independent party,
from the initial process of determining volumes to be DF/DCF.
• This verification is distinct from certification schemes used to determine DF/DCF status of
volumes, those volumes should be reported through 8.9 and 8.9.1.

Explanation of First-party verification: verification conducted by the company itself but carried out by personnel
terms not involved in the design or implementation of the operations being verified (AFi, 2024).
Monitoring: an ongoing function that uses the systematic collection of data on specific metrics to
assess and document the extent to which actions, progress, performance, and compliance are
being carried out or achieved (AFi, 2024).
Production unit: a plantation, farm, ranch, or forest management unit. This includes all plots used
for agriculture or forestry that are under one management, located in the same general area, and
share the same means of production. It also includes natural ecosystems, infrastructure, and other
land within or associated with the plantation, farm, ranch, or forest management unit.
o A production unit can be a contiguous land area (regardless of any internal
subdivisions) or a group of plots interspersed with other land units the same area
or landscape and under the same management (AFi, 2024).
Second-party verification: verification conducted by a related entity with an interest in the
company or operation being assessed, such as the business customer of a production/processing
operation or a contractor that also provides services other than verification (AFi, 2024).
Third-party verification: verification conducted by an independent entity that does not provide
other services to the company (AFi, 2024).
Verification: assessment and confirmation of compliance, performance, and/or actions relative to
a stated commitment, policy, goal, target, or other obligation. Verification signifies that information
is checked and confirmed by persons other than those involved in the operation or entity being
assessed (AFi, 2024).

Rationale Commodity volumes can be claimed to be DF or DCF if they originate in sourcing areas where
there is no or negligible risk that deforestation and/or conversion has occurred related to that
commodity since an appropriate cutoff date. Determining this risk requires ongoing monitoring
of the sourcing area. This question helps data users understand whether your organization is
making DF/DCF claims based on sourcing area-level risk assessment, and how your organization
is monitoring those sourcing areas to ensure the absence of deforestation or conversion risk.
Ambition • The organization discloses on their risk assessment process used to determine no or
negligible risk of sourcing areas.

• Volumes can be determined to be DF/DCF when there is no or negligible risk of deforestation
and/or conversion at the level of the sourcing area, with ongoing monitoring in place to ensure
the risk level is up to date.
• The sourcing area is an area or region from which materials in a value chain originate. This is
more specific than the country/area level, and could include a sourcing radius or a supply-shed
around a first point of collection or processing facility (e.g., a radius from a palm oil mill); a
defined set of production units supplying a particular aggregator or buyer (e.g. the area covered
by a smallholder cooperative); or a landscape or subnational jurisdiction (e.g. municipality)
from which materials are sourced (adapted from AFi, 2024).
• Where the organization can trace materials to a sourcing area in which no or negligible
deforestation and/or conversion has occurred since an appropriate cutoff date, they may
generally consider all volumes sourced from that area to be DF/DCF. If using this approach,
organizations must continue to monitor such sourcing areas to identify any change in the
occurrence or risk of deforestation or conversion. Monitoring at this scale should include all
deforestation/conversion, not only land use change directly linked to the commodity of interest.
If there is recent ecosystem conversion linked to agriculture or forestry in a sourcing area,
regardless of the direct driver or current land use, DF/DCF claims should not be made without
further due diligence, monitoring, and assurance. This may necessitate monitoring at a finer
scale and/or using data related to expansion of the commodity of interest or other publicly
available information. Organizations using this approach should disclose the methodology and
data used (Adapted from AFi 2022).
• This risk level monitoring must be robust and evidence based. It should be specific and
consider all relevant aspects of the risks related to the commodities, locations, and suppliers
under assessment. Risk assessments should use clear and well-defined metrics to objectively
evaluate the risks. The methods used should be credible, current, and provide all the data
necessary to effectively characterize the risk (Adapted from AFi, 2020).

DF/DCF status is verified (column 6)
• For volumes determined to be DF/DCF through monitoring the risk of deforestation or
conversion at the sourcing area, indicate if this status has been verified. Verification is a
separate process, conducted by an independent party, from the initial process of determining
volumes to be DF/DCF.
• This verification is distinct from certification schemes used to determine DF/DCF status of
volumes, those volumes should be reported through 8.9 and 8.9.1.

Explanation of • Classification system: a system for assessing the deforestation and conversion risk
terms associated with specific sourcing areas and classifying each geographic area with a risk
category based on a robust methodology.
• First-party verification: verification conducted by the company itself but carried out by
personnel not involved in the design or implementation of the operations being verified (AFi,
2024).
• Grievance mechanism: any routinised process through which grievances concerning
business-related negative impacts to human
rights or the environment can be raised and remedy can be sought. Grievance mechanisms
may be state-based or non-state-based and they may be judicial or non-judicial (AFi, 2024).
• Landscape and jurisdictional approach: a muti-stakeholder collaborative strategy to advance
shared sustainability goals and build resilience at landscape scale. A jurisdictional approach is
a landscape approach defined by administrative boundaries and with high level of government
involvement.
• Negligible risk: a conclusion, based on credible evidence, that it is exceedingly unlikely that
material produced in or sourced from a given context is non-compliant with one or more
aspects of a company’s social and environmental commitments, policies, or other obligations.
o Criteria for determining negligible risk should be defined in each sourcing region and
for each aspect of a company’s social and environmental commitments, policies, and
other obligations. A given production area could be considered negligible risk for one
aspect of a company’s social and environmental obligations but not negligible risk for
other aspects (adapted from AFi, 2024).
• Second-party verification: verification conducted by a related entity with an interest in the
company or operation being assessed, such as the business customer of a
production/processing operation or a contractor that also provides services other than
verification (AFi, 2024).
• Sourcing area: an area or region from which materials in a supply chain originate.
o Sourcing areas could include a sourcing radius or a supply-shed around a first point of
collection or processing facility (e.g., a radius from a palm oil mill); a defined set of
production units supplying a particular aggregator or buyer (e.g. the area covered by a
smallholder cooperative); or a landscape or subnational jurisdiction (e.g. municipality)
from which materials are sourced (AFi, 2024).
• Third-party verification: verification conducted by an independent entity that does not provide
other services to the company (AFi, 2024).
• Verification: assessment and confirmation of compliance, performance, and/or actions relative
to a stated commitment, policy, goal, target, or other obligation. Verification signifies that
information is checked and confirmed by persons other than those involved in the operation or
entity being assessed (AFi, 2024).
Additional Guidance on good practices for how to conduct a risk assessment and sourcing area monitoring
information are provided by the Accountability Framework initiative’s Operational Guidance on Supply Chain
Management (AFi, 2020) and Monitoring and Verification (AFi, 2020). AFi also provide further
guidance on deforestation- and conversion-free supply chains, in collaboration with the Science
Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol (AFi, 2022).

composition, structure, or function.
o Deforestation is one form of conversion (conversion of natural forests)
o Conversion includes severe degradation or the introduction of management practices
that result in a profound and sustained change in the ecosystem’s species
composition, structure, or function.
o Change to natural ecosystems that meets this definition is considered to be
conversion regardless of whether or not it is legal (AFi, 2024).
• Deforestation: loss of natural forest as a result of: i) conversion to agriculture or other non-
forest land use; ii) conversion to a tree plantation; or iii) severe and sustained degradation.
o Severe and sustained degradation (scenario iii in the definition) constitutes
deforestation even if the land is not subsequently used for non-forest land use.
o Loss of natural forest that meets this definition is considered to be deforestation
regardless of whether or not it is legal.
o The definition of deforestation signifies “gross deforestation” of a natural forest where
"gross" is used in the sense of "total; aggregate; without deduction for reforestation or
other offset." (adapted from AFi, 2024).

goals, targets, or other obligations (AFi, 2024).
• Deforestation-free (also referred to as: no-deforestation): commodity production, sourcing, or

o Deforestation-free refers to no gross deforestation of natural forests, which the
Accountability Framework specifies as the appropriate policy and goal on this topic for
companies and supply chains.
o In the context of the Accountability Framework, deforestation refers to the loss of
natural forest (see definition of deforestation).
o The terms “no-deforestation” and “deforestation-free” are used in favor of “zero
deforestation” because “zero” can imply an absolutist approach that may be at odds
with the need sometimes to accommodate minimal levels of conversion at the site
level in the interest of facilitating optimal conservation and production outcomes (see
AFi’s definition for minimal level [of deforestation or conversion], 2024) (adapted from
AFi, 2024)
• Deforestation- and conversion-free (also referred to as "no-conversion"): commodity

Questionnaire sector Question level All (except FS)
(8.11) For volumes not assessed and determined as deforestation- and conversion-free (DCF), indicate if
you have taken actions in the reporting year to increase production or sourcing of DCF volumes.
Question details
Question This question only appears you select any options except “Yes, deforestation- and conversion-
dependencies free (DCF) status assessed” in column “DF/DCF status assessed for this commodity”, or if a
value other than “100” is disclosed in column “% of disclosure volume determined as DF/DCF in

Rationale This question allows organizations to disclose actions taken in the reporting year related to
volumes that are not yet assessed and determined as DCF. Achieving deforestation- and
conversion-free value chains may take longer for organizations engaging in transformative
actions across sourcing landscapes. This question allows data users to understand the actions
your organization is taking to address environmental or social issues related to commodity
production/sourcing and if and how these actions contribute to determining the DCF status of
commodity volumes or remediate past conversion.
Ambition • Organizations are progressing towards achieving full DCF status in their direct operations
and value chain.
• Organizations contribute to halting deforestation and conversion on the ground by actively
working with non-compliant suppliers, ensuring smallholder inclusion, and working
collaboratively in landscapes/jurisdictions.

General
content
• You should answer this question in the context of the reporting year, for your disclosed
commodities, and only for actions implemented related to land use management and land
use change.
• The actions implemented could include any intervention that introduces a change to
production, practice or switched supply to reduce emissions and/or enhance removals.
The implementation may include several activities that reduce or remove emissions in
different ways and that may or may not be included within the corporate GHG inventory.
Description of actions (column 2)
• Provide an explanation as to how the action implemented has resulted in GHG emissions
reductions and removals.
• The company should be able to demonstrate that their actions substantively contributed to
or enable the resulting emissions benefit. If it is a joint approach with other companies that
have resulted in an emissions benefit, this should be stated here.
• Examples of actions implemented could include:
o The increased procurement/production of commodities traceable to origin;
o The increased procurement/production of certified commodities;
o A verifiable reduction in deforestation and conversion of other natural ecosystems;
o The increased procurement/production of commodities compliant with no
deforestation and or no conversion commitments, policies, goals, targets, or other
obligations;
o Ecosystem restoration/reforestation/afforestation projects.
CO2e reductions and removals achieved from base year (metric tons CO2e) (column 3)
111

• To understand the net change, it is important to report these reductions and removals in
the context of the base year. The base year will be prior to any action being implemented.
• Enter the expected annual CO e reductions or removals in metric tons that have occurred.
2
It is acknowledged that this figure is likely to be an estimate.
• Reductions should be reported compared to emissions in the base year.
• Removals should be reported compared to the cumulative rate of removal in the base year.
Base year (column 4)
• The base year is the year against which you are comparing your reductions or removals
achieved.
• Enter your base year from which you are reporting your CO e reductions. This is prior to the
2
action being implemented, or within a reasonable timeframe (i.e. where data is available
and can be verified).
• You cannot have a base year that is in the future.
Emissions accounting boundary (column 5)
• In line with GHG Protocol, when companies implement internal projects that reduce GHG
emissions from their operations, the resulting reductions are usually captured in their
inventory’s boundaries.
• If the claims to the emissions reductions are sold to third parties as carbon credits, then
the reporting company shall not include them in the corporate inventory.
• If companies make changes to their own operations that result in GHG emissions changes
at sources not included in their own inventory boundary, these reductions shall be reported
separately from the GHG inventory.
Scope (column 6)
• If you have selected "Included in the corporate GHG inventory boundary" or "Partly included
in the corporate GHG inventory boundary" you will need to select the relevant scopes.
• The scopes will depend on the operations owned or controlled by a particular company. For
most processors, traders, distributors, manufacturers, and retailers, emissions would be
considered scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services (i.e. emissions
embedded in the purchase of raw materials). However, these emissions may fall under
scope 1 for vertically integrated food companies and producers.
Emissions accounting methodology and standards (column 7)
• Select the options that best describe the methods and standards used to calculate your
emissions reduction figure reported in column 3 “CO e reductions…”.
2
• If none of the options are applicable to your organization, select "An established project-
level methodology, please specify" and indicate the methodology you used to calculate the
figure in column 3 “CO2e reductions and removals achieved from base year (metric tons
CO2e)”.
Explain calculation (column 8)
• If the reported emission reductions and removals are only partly included in the corporate
GHG inventory, specify the share included and explain how it was defined.
Additional • The following GHG calculations tools can be used for assessing commodity-specific
information emissions:
- RSPO PalmGHG Calculator
- GHG Protocol Pulp and Paper tool
- Cool Farm tool
- FAO EX-ACT tool
112

Explanation of • Environmental Regularization Program or PRA (Brazilian Forest Code): defines the activities
terms to be implemented within or outside the rural property to comply with the Brazilian Forest
Code, including the conservation, reforestation or restoration of APPs, Restricted Use Areas,
as well as the compensation of Legal Reserve areas.
• Legal compliance (with forest regulations and/or mandatory standards): involves adhering
to the rules prescribed by government which regulate the use, protection and/or conservation
of forests. Regulations encompass tenure and use rights, protected areas, sustainable forest
management and compliance with trade and customs laws. Mandatory standards require
compliance from all relevant companies within a jurisdiction, as with the Indonesian
Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) standard which applies to all oil palm growers operating in
Indonesia (adapted from the Forest Legality Initiative and SPOTT).
• Legal Reserve or RL (Brazilian Forest Code): the proportion of the land on which native
vegetation must be maintained in Brazil. Requirements for the proportion of land which must
be set aside vary depending on the biome a municipality is officially located in. In the Legal
Amazon the proportion is 50-85, in the Cerrado 35% and elsewhere 20% (WWF, 2015).
115

• Permanent Protection Areas or APP (Brazilian Forest Code): under Brazilian law, there are
areas which must be set aside such as river banks, watersheds and steep slopes. APP are
physically and ecologically fragile and provide important environmental services. These areas
vary between properties and may be allocated within the Legal Reserve (WWF, 2015).
• Rural Environmental Registry or CAR (Brazilian Forest Code): the central tool for rural
properties to become compliant with the Brazilian Forest Code requirements. All rural property
owners must register their lands in CAR, including the location of APPs, Legal Reserves, and
other elements. CAR is regulated by the National System of Information on the Environment
(SINIMA) (WWF, 2015).
• Terms of Commitment (Brazilian Forest Code): in Brazil, a formal document signed by the
rural landowner in which he or she commits to redress the environmental deficit of the
property, including, at least, commitments to conserve, reforest or restore APPs, Legal
Reserves and Restricted Use Areas. Legal Reserve areas may be restored or compensated
(WWF, 2015).
Additional For an overview of the Brazilian Forest Code see WWF (2015), and for further information on
information assessing compliance with the Forest Code consult Proforest (2017).

Rationale A growing number of organizations, as well as platforms such as the Consumer Goods Forum
and the Soft Commodities Forum, are incorporating landscape and jurisdictional approaches and
initiatives as a part of corporate sustainability strategies. Working collaboratively with multiple
actors at landscape and jurisdictional scale is increasingly accepted as a best practice approach
to driving conservation and restoration impacts at scale, tackling deforestation and conversion
commitments through a value chain and achieving sustainability goals, especially where there
are systemic challenges in production landscapes. This question helps data users to understand
which organizations are taking this approach and engaging in such landscape and jurisdictional
initiatives.
Ambition The organization engages collaboratively to drive shared goals that contribute to positive
outcomes in landscapes and jurisdictions.

Requested General
content • Engagement in landscape approaches and initiatives differ from other local engagements
in that the goals and outcomes are defined at the landscape level and reached collectively
through a multi-stakeholder governance process and are jointly monitored and reported on
through an integrated landscape management framework.
• Engagement can range from involvement in set-up and management of an initiative to
preferential sourcing, or undertaking any activities that supports the goals of the landscape
or jurisdictional initiative.
• Select “Yes, we engage in landscape/jurisdictional initiatives” if you have any engagement
activities aligned with the collective goals of a landscape or jurisdictional initiative,
regardless of whether these activities are linked to your own sourcing or production of
commodities or the activities are separate to your own sourcing/production.

Explanation of • Landscape: defined geographic area with common and interacting ecological and
terms socioeconomic characteristics. They may be delineated based on river basins, seascapes,
ecosystems, jurisdictional boundaries, or in other ways (adapted from AFi, 2024).
• Landscape and jurisdictional approach: a muti-stakeholder collaborative strategy to
advance shared sustainability goals and build resilience at landscape scale. A jurisdictional
approach is a landscape approach defined by administrative boundaries and with high level
of government involvement.
• Landscape and jurisdictional initiatives: the on-the-ground collaborative program to set
common goals, take collective action while reconciling different interests, and monitor
progress towards improving social, environmental, and economic outcomes at a
landscape/jurisdictional scale.

Rationale To effectively address deforestation, achieve sustainability targets, and to secure supply chain
operations, organizations need to actively engage in the landscapes/jurisdictions they depend
on. They will likely have key knowledge and expertise to share with existing initiatives and be able
to progress shared goals effectively. Investors and other data users are interested in knowing
how organizations identify collaborations that maximize value and positive impact.
Prioritizing a landscape should go beyond a country/area level analysis to the regions within a
value chain that pose the highest risk from deforestation and conversion. It will also identify
landscapes that present opportunities for collaboration, such as governmental commitments
and the presence of existing initiatives, including for production, conservation, and restoration
activities. This requires an understanding of the overlay between footprint and risk/opportunity
within these production landscapes.
It is critical that organizations establish a definition for the priority landscapes within their
sourcing footprint, and a set of criteria for choosing which landscape to engage in – such as a
risk of non-compliance with sourcing policies or the presence of conditions that foster
meaningful engagement. This ensures that the engagement and type of intervention integrates
with the organization’s sustainability strategy and risk assessment approach. Prioritizing action
is important to maximize the potential impact of the engagement. It is important to consider
enabling conditions both in the landscape/jurisdiction and in the organization.
118

Ambition • The organization engages collaboratively to drive shared goals that contribute to positive
outcomes in landscapes and jurisdictions.
• The organization prioritizes which landscapes or jurisdictions to engage in based on where
they are well-placed to have positive impact.

Explanation of • Conversion: loss of a natural ecosystem as a result of its replacement with agriculture or
terms another land use, or due to a profound and sustained change in the natural ecosystem’s
species composition, structure, or function.
o Deforestation is one form of conversion (conversion of natural forests).
o Conversion includes severe degradation or the introduction of management practices
that result in a profound and sustained change in the ecosystem’s species
composition, structure, or function.
o Change to natural ecosystems that meets this definition is considered to be
conversion regardless of whether or not it is legal (AFi, 2024).
• Deforestation: loss of natural forest as a result of: i) conversion to agriculture or other non-
forest land use; ii) conversion to a tree plantation; or iii) severe and sustained degradation.
o Severe and sustained degradation (scenario iii in the definition) constitutes
deforestation even if the land is not subsequently used for non-forest land use.
o Loss of natural forest that meets this definition is considered to be deforestation
regardless of whether or not it is legal.
o The definition of deforestation signifies “gross deforestation” of natural forest where
“gross” is used in the sense of “total; aggregate; without deduction for reforestation or
other offset.” (adapted from AFi, 2024).
• Natural ecosystem: an ecosystem that substantially resembles—in terms of species
composition, structure, and ecological function—one that is or would be found in a given area in
the absence of major human impacts. This includes human-managed ecosystems where much
of the natural species composition, structure, and ecological function are present (AFi, 2024).
• Smallholder: small-scale agricultural or forest products producers that are distinct from larger-
scale producers found in similar contexts by virtue of many or all of the following
characteristics:
o High degree of dependence on family labor;
o Profits accrue primarily to the farm/forest owner and their family;
o The farm/forest provides a primary source of income livelihood for the smallholder;
o Production units have a relatively small land footprint (relative to the range of
production unit sizes for the given commodity and region);
o Household resources are allocated to both food crops and cash crops;
o Relatively low use of agricultural inputs and generally low productivity and yields;
o Significant economic constraints, such as lack of capital assets and low access to
finance;
o Significant information constraints, including lack of technical knowledge and low
access to market information (adapted from AFi, 2024).
• Convener: An individual, organization or other stakeholder that leads or facilitates the design,
set-up and high-level management of the initiative.
• Implementer: An individual, organization or other stakeholder that executes actions based on
collective goals.

Requested
General
content
• When completing this question, you may report engagement activity that is in direct
support of a landscape and/or jurisdictional initiative.
• Consider whether the landscape level initiative can be considered as a jurisdictional
initiative. If it is setting and monitoring outcomes at the level of a political boundary (for
example state/province/district/municipality), with direct engagement from the
government in supporting the outcomes, then this is a jurisdictional initiative (see
explanation of “Landscape and jurisdictional initiative” below).
• You must only report engagement that was active during the reporting period.
• Add a new row for each jurisdictional/landscape initiative you are engaged in.
Landscape/jurisdiction ID (column 1)

Explanation of • Landscape: defined geographic area with common and interacting ecological and
terms socioeconomic characteristics. They may be delineated based on river basins, seascapes,
ecosystems, jurisdictional boundaries, or in other ways.
• Landscape and Jurisdictional Approach: A muti-stakeholder collaborative strategy to
advance shared sustainability goals and build resilience at landscape scale. A jurisdictional
approach is a landscape approach defined by administrative boundaries and with high level
of government involvement.
• Landscape and jurisdictional initiatives: the on-the-ground collaborative program to set
common goals, take collective action while reconciling different interests, and monitor
progress towards improving social, environmental, and economic outcomes at a
landscape/jurisdictional scale.
• Agroforestry: a land management approach that combines the production of trees with
other crops and/or livestock. Trees have high adaptive capacity because they are deep
rooted and have large reserves of water and nutrients, and are less susceptible than annual
crops to inter-annual variability or short-lived extreme events like droughts or floods.
127

Additionally, trees improve soil quality and fertility by contributing to water retention and by
reducing water stress during low rainfall years, and also have higher evapotranspiration
rates than row crops or pastures and can thus pump excess water out of the soil. Trees
can also reduce the impacts of weather extremes such as droughts or torrential rain and
can stabilize the soil against landslides and raise infiltration rates.
• Assessment Framework: provides a structure for assessing progress towards the pre-
defined goals of a landscape or jurisdictional initiative. It defines the indicators that
collectively characterize the sustainability of a landscape, and can provide mechanisms for
measuring accountability and tracking performance metrics.
• Conversion: loss of a natural ecosystem as a result of its replacement with agriculture or
another land use, or due to a profound and sustained change in the natural ecosystem’s
species composition, structure, or function.
o Deforestation is one form of conversion (conversion of natural forests).
o Conversion includes severe degradation or the introduction of management
practices that result in a profound and sustained change in the ecosystem’s
species composition, structure, or function.
o Change to natural ecosystems that meets this definition is considered to be
conversion regardless of whether or not it is legal (AFi, 2024).
• Deforestation: loss of natural forest as a result of: i) conversion to agriculture or other non-
forest land use; ii) conversion to a tree plantation; or iii) severe and sustained degradation.
o Severe and sustained degradation (scenario iii in the definition) constitutes
deforestation even if the land is not subsequently used for non-forest land use.
o Loss of natural forest that meets this definition is considered to be deforestation
regardless of whether or not it is legal.
o The definition of deforestation signifies “gross deforestation” of natural forest
where “gross” is used in the sense of “total; aggregate; without deduction for
reforestation or other offset.” (adapted from AFi, 2024)
• Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC): a collective human right of indigenous peoples
and local communities to give and withhold their consent prior to the commencement of
any activity that may affect their rights, land, resources, territories, livelihoods, and food
security. It is a right exercised through representatives of their own choosing and in a
manner consistent with their own customs, values, and norms (AFi, 2024).
• Grievance mechanism: any routinized process through which grievances concerning
business-related negative impacts on human rights or the environment can be raised, and
remedy can be sought. Grievance mechanisms may be State-based or non-State based
and they may be judicial or non-judicial (AFi, 2024).
• Landscape sustainability assessment: an assessment, usually conducted through an
established framework, that provides a holistic overview of the landscape in relation to
human, social, economic, and environmental factors and issues.
• Natural ecosystem: an ecosystem that substantially resembles - in terms of species
composition, structure, and ecological function - one that is or would be found in a given
area in the absence of major human impacts. This includes human-managed ecosystems
where much of the natural species composition, structure, and ecological function are
present (AFi, 2024).
• Restoration: the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem, and its associated
conservation values, that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed (SER, 2004).
• Smallholder: small-scale agricultural or forest products producers that are distinct from
larger-scale producers found in similar contexts by virtue of many or all of the following
characteristics:
o High degree of dependence on family labor.
o Profits accrue primarily to the farm/forest owner and their family.
o The farm/forest provides a primary source of income livelihood for the smallholder.
128

o Production units have a relatively small land footprint (relative to the range of
production unit sizes for the given commodity and region).
o Household resources are allocated to both food crops and cash crops.
o Relatively low use of agricultural inputs and generally low productivity and yields.
o Significant economic constraints, such as lack of capital assets and low access to
finance.
o Significant information constraints, including lack of technical knowledge and low
access to market information (adapted from AFi, 2024).
• Traceability: the ability to follow a product or its components through stages of the
upstream value chain (e.g., production, processing, manufacturing, and distribution)
(adapted from AFi, 2024).
• Individual claim: a type of claim about the direct actions/investments and progress on
implementing these by an organization, or the attribution of performance outcomes that
resulted solely from the organizations actions/investment.
• Collective claim: the most broadly applicable type of claim about landscape-scale
performance outcomes. It recognizes the general or proportional contributions to the
collective efforts & outcomes achieved.
Additional • For information on good practices for engaging in landscape and jurisdictional initiatives

Explanation of • Afforestation: establishment of forest through planting and/or deliberate seeding on land
terms that, until then, was not classified as forest, which implies a transformation of land use
from non-forest to forest (FAO, 2015).
• Agroforestry: a land management approach that combines the production of trees with
other crops and/or livestock. Trees have high adaptive capacity because they are deep
rooted and have large reserves of water and nutrients, and are less susceptible than annual
crops to inter-annual variability or short-lived extreme events like droughts or floods.
Additionally, trees improve soil quality and fertility by contributing to water retention and by
reducing water stress during low rainfall years, and also have higher evapotranspiration
rates than row crops or pastures and can thus pump excess water out of the soil. Trees
can also reduce the impacts of weather extremes such as droughts or torrential rain and
can stabilize the soil against landslides and raise infiltration rates.
• Biodiversity offsetting: measures taken to compensate for any residual significant,
adverse impacts that cannot be avoided, minimized and / or rehabilitated or restored, in
order to achieve no net loss or a net gain of biodiversity. Offsets can take the form of
positive management interventions such as restoration of degraded habitat, arrested
degradation or averted risk, protecting areas where there is imminent or projected loss of
biodiversity (BBOP 2012).
• Latitude and longitude: geographic coordinates that specify, respectively, the north-south
and east-west position, of a point on the Earth's surface. These coordinates are expressed
as angular measures and thus, latitude can vary from 0 to +/-90; longitude can vary from 0
to +/-180.
• Natural ecosystem: an ecosystem that substantially resembles - in terms of species
composition, structure, and ecological function - one that is or would be found in a given
area in the absence of major human impacts. This includes human-managed ecosystems
where much of the natural species composition, structure, and ecological function are
present (AFi, 2024).
• Set-aside land: land owned/managed by the company that is not used for production or
planned development and is set-aside for conservation purposes.
• Threatened and protected species: all species assessed as a threatened category on
IUCN’s Red List of Threatened Species, as well as other species considered threatened or
otherwise protected by international, national or subnational laws and regulation.

Module 9: Environmental Performance – Water security
Module The promotion of water security for all is supported when companies:
Overview
• Reduce their dependency on freshwater sources and track their progress;
• Collect and share volumetric data on their interactions with water resources.
• Are aware of the water intensity of their value creation.
• Consider water throughout their value chain, beyond the fence-line of their direct
operations.
Clean freshwater is becoming increasingly scarce, and this can impact operations relying on large
volumes of water. The information in this module enables CDP data users to understand an
organization’s exclusions, organization-wide water accounting, facility level water accounting &
verification, water efficiency and water intensity, products and services, and water-related targets.
The questions in this module allow your organization to demonstrate how well it understands its
corporate hydrology by providing information on the monitoring of relevant water aspects. This
includes volumetric data on withdrawals, including from water stressed areas, discharges by level
of treatment, and consumption. CDP also requests companies to comment on their projections
for water accounting data.
In addition to volumetric data, in order to protect water quality, companies are requested to report
on their emissions to water and their use of hazardous substances.
For organizations responding to a request from a CDP Supply Chain member, this module also
includes questions on the impact of facilities on requesting supply chain members (section 9.4).
Note:
Throughout the water security module, CDP has broadened the scope of questions about the
supply chain to include other phases of the value chain. This will be particularly relevant to
companies whose activities may be constrained or otherwise affected by water related issues
beyond their direct operations and supply chains. It reflects a widening of company focus to, and
greater investor interest in, risk exposure, opportunities and impacts within the value chain.
Disclosure note
CDP’s approach to reporting water accounting data
• When reporting volumetric data please read the guidance for each question as well as the
CDP Technical Note on water accounting definitions.
• To reduce their impact on water ecosystems and resources as well as their need to
manage water-related risks, organizations should minimize and be able to account for all
their interaction with water. For this reason, CDP’s focus is the collection of information to
determine how well a company understands the flow of water into and out of its
boundaries, and whether they have robust monitoring and accounting in place for all
aspects of their water use.
• Definitions: CDP is looking for comparable data, reported against a standard
methodology/definition. To ensure the quality of our data and a fair scoring methodology,
CDP definitions should be used for all disclosures. This is particularly relevant where there
is a lack of standardization. Companies must not provide water accounting data that
does not align with the definitions given. Please refer to CDP’s Technical Note on water
accounting.
• Units: Volumes must be reported in megaliters per year (1 megaliter = 1 million liters or
1,000 m3) in all questions, unless otherwise stated.
141

• Blank cells: Please ensure when responding to these water accounting questions that
cells are only intentionally left blank if you have no data to disclose. Blank cells are
interpreted as non-disclosure, i.e. information is not available due to lack of measurement
or choosing not to disclose, and are therefore awarded no points by the scoring
methodology.
• Values of zero: entering a zero implies a measurement has been made, and the value is
zero. For example, a value of zero consumption reported indicates that no water is
incorporated into products or waste products or lost by evaporation from the company.
Do not use a zero to indicate a lack of data. If a company enters a zero for discharge, it
should provide an explanation.
• Data accuracy: CDP recognizes that there may be uncertainty linked to water accounting
information that could impact on data accuracy. Uncertainty can arise from data gaps,
assumptions, metering/measurement constraints including equipment accuracy, data
management, etc. The emphasis should be on reporting transparently and on providing
an explanation for why reported data is uncertain or wholly or partially estimated or
modelled, rather than sourced from direct measurements.
Sector-specific • Additional questions on organization-wide water accounting and water efficiency and
content water intensity for the following high-impact sectors: Agricultural commodities, Coal,
Chemicals, Electric Utilities, Food, Beverage & Tobacco, Oil & gas, Metals & Minning.
• Additional response options are presented in:
o 9.2 for the Oil & Gas, Metals & Minning, and Coal sectors
o 9.2.5, 9.2.6, 9.8 and 9.9 for the Food, Beverage & Tobacco and Agricultural
commodities sectors
o 9.2.1, 9.7 and 9.7.1 for the Electric utilities sector
o 9.6 and 9.6.1 for the Chemicals sector
o 9.10 and 9.10.1 for the Coal and Metals & Minning sectors
o 9.11 and 9.11.1 for the Oil & gas sector

• Organizations should report on all exclusions. Any environmental performance data
relating to groups, companies, businesses or organizations that is relevant for your
organization to disclose under your chosen consolidation approach, as indicated in 6.1,
but not included in your disclosure of water related data should be disclosed in 9.1.1. In all
cases, the following principles of relevance and transparency must apply to all disclosures
(adapted from the GHG Protocol):
o Relevance: Ensure the disclosure appropriately reflects the water use of the company
and serves the decision-making needs of users – both internal and external to the
company.
o Transparency: Address all relevant issues in a factual and coherent manner, based on
a clear audit trail. Disclose any relevant assumptions and make appropriate references
to the accounting and calculation methodologies and data sources used.
• Note that in some questions, e.g. in the facility level water accounting section, we will ask
you to provide data only for facilities where substantive water-related dependencies,
impacts, risks and opportunities have been identified, rather than all facilities within your
reporting boundary.
• If you selected 'No' in column 1 ‘'Is your reporting boundary for your CDP disclosure the
same as that used in your financial statements?’ of 1.5 and there are entities included in
your consolidated accounting group that are not included in your reporting boundary,
select 'Yes' and provide details on the exclusion of these entities in 9.1.1.
Explanation of • Facilities: may be used throughout this questionnaire as a broad term and not restricted
terms to a particular site or grouping of fixed buildings and factories. For example, if your
organization is in the extractive industries, you might normally collate business
information for assets or business units, and so you may wish to define “facility”
information in this way.
Additional The GHG Protocol states that an acknowledgement of all exclusions should be made each year to
information enhance transparency despite disclosure of the same exclusion in previous years. This ensures all
data users are always aware of what data has been included in your response.

Requested General
content • Organizations should report on all exclusions. Any environmental performance data relating to
groups, companies, businesses or organizations that is relevant for your organization to
disclose under your chosen consolidation approach, as indicated in 6.1, but not included in your
disclosure of water related data should be disclosed here.
• The significance of an exclusion will depend on factors such as the sector and related business
activities of the company; the geographical location, including if the exclusion represents
operations in a specific place (as well as the watershed context of that location, such as
whether it is under high levels of water stress); and the environmental impact of the exclusion
relative to the whole. The qualitative information provided should address the above points as
much as possible.
• If your organization has multiple exclusions, add a row for each.
Exclusion (column 1)
145

• Select the category that best describes the exclusion. Identify if any of the following are
excluded from your disclosure:
o Business activities, e.g. a product line, type of business process, or type of supplier,
may be excluded due to limited data or reporting feasibility.
§ Organizations that have water supply networks as part of their activities under
CDP’s Activity Classification System may exclude water accounting data in
relation to the production of drinking water in sections “Company-wide water
accounting”, “Facility-level water accounting”, and “Water efficiency and water
intensity”.
o Country/geographical area, e.g. low water usage or data limitations may make
reporting infeasible for operations in a country/area/region.
o Facilities may be excluded due to recent mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures (which
have taken place during the reporting year), outsourcing and in-sourcing of activities
(smaller facilities for which it is not currently possible to track water use may also be
considered for exclusion).
o Specific groups, companies, businesses, or organizations that fall within your
organizational boundary but are not included in your disclosure.
o Water aspects, e.g. a company may use rainwater at some facilities, but it is a small
volume and excluding it causes less than a 5% error in the organization’s water balance.
In which case, the source may be considered for exclusion.
Description of exclusion (column 2)
• Clearly outline your exclusion, including details such as the exact geographical location, activity,
and the name of the business unit, product line or facility.
• You will be able to specify the reason for your exclusion in column 3.
Reason for exclusion (column 3)
• Select the category that best describes the reason why the exclusion is not included in your
disclosure of water-related data.
• Select “Water supply networks” if this is one of your organization’s activities under CDP’s Activity
Classification System, and you intend to exclude your data related to the production of drinking
water.
• Select “Small volume [rainwater]” if you intend to exclude rainwater from your disclosure and
this would cause less than a 5% error in your organization’s water balance. Note that if
precipitation/rainwater volumes constitute a principal input of water at a site level, these
volumes should not be excluded.
• Select “Recent acquisition or merger” if you intend to exclude data related to an acquisition or
merger which has taken place during the reporting year. Provide the completion date for the
acquisition or merger and indicate if this data will be incorporated in next year’s disclosure in
columns 5 and 6, respectively.
• If “Data is not available” is selected, you will be asked in column 4 "Primary reason why data is
not available” why the data for your exclusion is not available.
Completion date of acquisition or merger (column 5)
146

• If the completion date of the acquisition or merger has not yet passed, you should report the
final date of your reporting year (as disclosed in question 1.4).
Percentage of water volume the exclusion represents (column 7)
• Select the percentage of the proportion of water volumes that the exclusion represents e.g. % of
total water withdrawal (or consumption).
• Use the “Please explain” column to specify if this percentage refers to water withdrawals,
discharges, or consumption volumes.
Please explain (column 8)
• Provide a reasonable explanation as to how you arrived at this exclusion, e.g., as a result of a
high-level risk scanning exercise.
• If you selected “Judged to be unimportant or not relevant” in the column “Primary reason why
data is not available”, explain the criteria used to decide that data is not important or relevant to
your organization and therefore not available.
• If you selected “Recent acquisition or merger” and do not plan to include this in the next
reporting period, provide details on when you expect to include the water-related data of the
acquired or merged company in your disclosure.
• If you selected “Small volume [rainwater]” due to rainwater harvesting where the resulting error
in water balance would be less than 5%, provide details on this exclusion.
• Specify if the percentage disclosed in the previous column refers to water withdrawals,
discharges, or consumption volumes.
• Indicate if the exclusion represents a significant portion of the total water used (or consumed) or
the pollution load discharged.

Requested content
Note: Organizations responding to an electric utilities, metals & mining, coal, or oil & gas
sector request should refer to additional sector-specific guidance on this question at the end
of the "Requested content” section.
General
• This question seeks a company-wide response about your monitoring of various
water aspects. “Across all your operations” refers to all entities included in your
reporting boundary, indicated in 1.5.
• Please refer to CDP’s water accounting definitions (included in CDP Technical Note
– Water Accounting Definitions) before completing this question.
• You should only select “Not monitored” if you do not collect any data on these water
aspects across your operations. If you have data from any information sources, you
should reflect this in your response by indicating the percentage of
149

sites/facilities/operations this represents in the “% of sites/facilities/operations”
column.
• If water accounting information cannot be provided for all operations within your
reporting boundary, then use column 4 to explain the level of coverage.
• The proportion of sites/facilities/operations reported in column 1 is not considered
an indication of the proportion of total water volumes monitored in your
organization. It provides organizational coverage of monitoring activity only.
• Note that for column 1, ‘sites/facilities/operations’ could include a broad variety of
groupings of business operations, assets, fixed buildings, factories or sites etc. A
company-specific explanation may be provided in column 4.
Water aspect (column 0)
• Definitions for each type of water aspect are included in the ‘Explanation of terms’
for this question (and repeated in the Glossary).
% of sites/facilities/operations (column 1)
• Select the proportion of your organization’s facilities that are regularly (at least
annually) measured and monitored for each of the defined aspects; e.g. a company
that has 100 facilities across its total operations and regularly measures and
monitors total volumes of water withdrawals for 50% (50 facilities) would select “26-
50”.
• If a water aspect is only relevant to a proportion of your facilities, report the
percentage of these facilities for which you measure and monitor the given water
aspect and provide your explanation in column 4. For example, a company has 100
facilities across its total operations out of which “water discharge quality by effluent
parameters” is only relevant to the operation of 50% (50 facilities). If the company
regularly measures and monitors water discharge quality by effluent parameters for
all relevant facilities (50 facilities), they would select “100%” and state in column 4
that the relevance of this water aspect was considered.
• Select ‘Not relevant’ if it is not technically feasible or technically desirable for your
organization to monitor this aspect; e.g. your operations do not consume water so
measurement of this is not required, your company does not recycle/reuse water
because it is not considered cost effective. Provide your explanation in column 4.
• Select ‘Not monitored’ if your company does not monitor this aspect, though it
would be technically possible or desirable; e.g. your company does recycle/reuse
water but it is not yet monitored at the corporate level. Provide your explanation in
column 4.
Frequency of measurement (column 2)
• This column is not presented for the rows of any water aspects where ‘Not
monitored’ or ‘Not relevant’ is selected in column 1.
• If you have multiple frequencies of measurement across different
sites/facilities/operations, select the one that applies to the majority of your
sites/facilities/operations.
• If none of the response options listed reflect the frequency of your measurements,
you may select a frequency that is included in the scope of your own measurement
frequency and provide details in the Please explain column. For example, if you
150

measure a water aspect weekly, you may select "Monthly", as a month is the
minimum frequency listed that would capture weekly.
• Note that this column requests data on your frequency of measurement, not
frequency of reporting or compiling of information.
Method of measurement (column 3)
• This column is not presented for the rows of any water aspects where ‘Not
monitored’ or ‘Not relevant’ is selected in column 1.
• Explain the method of measurement of your water aspects, e.g., through direct
monitoring, estimation from a hydrological model, or other secondary source of
information.
• If you indicated that you monitor ‘Water withdrawals quality’ to determine the
suitability of the water for its intended use, you may include a list of parameters
measured in this column. This row supports the aims of the UN Environment Global
Environment Monitoring System for Freshwater (GEMS/Water), a long-term project
to generate data flows on global water quality.
Please explain (column 4)
• If you selected ‘Not relevant’ in column 1, provide a brief explanation of why this
water aspect is not relevant for your company and whether this water aspect is
expected to be relevant in the future.
• If you selected ‘Not monitored’ in column 1, provide a brief explanation of why this
water aspect is not monitored in your company.
• If you selected a percentage in column 1:
• Provide an explanation for your response in column 1; such as why your
organization measures/monitors the water aspect at this proportion of its
operations, and explain which sites/facilities/operations are excluded and why.
• State if your response in column 1 relates to facilities, sites or operations, or another
kind of grouping, and explain how you are using the term; e.g. “For our company,
‘facilities’ refers to our warehouses and retail outlets”; “Our response in this row
relates to our different geographic operations. We do not have facilities or sites
because we provide a range of services that are not tied to a specific location”.
Sector-specific guidance for electric utilities sector
General
• This guidance is specific to companies responding to an electric utilities sector
request. You should first read the guidance for this question that applies to all
companies. This is additional to the general guidance and does not replace it.
Water aspect (column 0)
• Water withdrawals – total volume: CDP recognizes the difficulty in accounting for
some elements of the hydropower operations’ water balance, specifically surface
runoff or elements that are outside the organization’s control such as third-party
discharges into the reservoir. Water withdrawals into hydropower operations include
river inflow, surface runoff and precipitation onto the reservoir surface, as well as
third-party discharges into the reservoir:
151

W = Precipitation+ River Inflow + Runoff + Third-party discharges into reservoir
Note that estimation or modelling are valid sources of data.
• Water withdrawals – volumes by source: Water withdrawals into hydropower
operations include river inflow, surface runoff and precipitation onto the reservoir
surface, as well as third-party discharges into the reservoir. Organizations should
strive to monitor those sources if they would result in an estimated error in the
water balance of more than 5%. Note that estimation or modelling are valid sources
of data.
• Water withdrawals – quality data: In hydropower operations please consider the
monitoring of reservoir water quality when responding to this question.
• Water recycling & reuse: CDP recognizes that water recycling and reuse practices
in wind, solar and hydropower operations are less common and less relevant. In
hydropower operations, only pumped-storage operations can be considered for
water reuse. It is expected that most organizations will report 0 for their hydropower
operations in this question. In light of this:
o Organizations with more than 70% of their power generation coming from
these sources may select “Not relevant”.
o Organizations with less than 70% of their power generation coming from
these sources should select the response that best reflects their company’s
monitoring activity in their operations outside the hydropower, wind or solar
generation sources. Indicate in column 4 (Please explain) how the use of
these sources affects the proportion of sites monitored that you are
reporting.
• Water discharges – total volume: CDP recognizes the difficulty in accounting for
some elements of the hydropower operations’ water balance, specifically seepage or
those that are outside the organization’s control such as third-party withdrawals.
In hydropower operations, water discharge includes the dam outlet and the spillway,
underground seepage and third-party withdrawals from the reservoir (for example a
municipal water plant abstracting from the reservoir).
D = Dam outlet + Spillway + Seepage + Third-party withdrawals from the reservoir
Note that estimation or modelling are valid sources of data.
• Water discharges – volumes by destination: In hydropower operations, water
discharge includes the dam outlet and the spillway, underground seepage and third-
party withdrawals from the reservoir (for example a municipal water plant
abstracting from the reservoir). Organizations should strive to monitor those
destinations if they would result in an estimated error in their water balance of more
than 5%. Note that estimation or modelling are valid sources of data.
• Water discharges – volumes by treatment method: CDP recognizes that discharge
quality data is rarely measured in organizations operating with wind, solar and
hydropower generation sources. In light of this:
o Organizations with more than 70% of their power generation coming from
these sources may select “Not relevant”.
o Organizations with less than 70% of their power generation coming from
these sources should select the response that best reflects their company’s
monitoring activity in their operations outside the hydropower, wind or solar
152

generation sources. Indicate in column 4 (Please explain) how the use of
these sources affects the proportion of sites monitored that you are
reporting.
• Water discharge quality data – by standard effluent parameters: CDP recognizes
that discharge quality data is rarely measured in organizations operating with wind,
solar and hydropower generation sources. In light of this:
o Organizations with more than 70% of their power generation coming from
these sources may select “Not relevant”.
o Organizations with less than 70% of their power generation coming from
these sources should select the response that best reflects their company’s
monitoring activity in their operations outside the hydropower, wind or solar
generation sources. Indicate in column 4 (Please explain) how the use of
these sources affects the proportion of sites monitored that you are
reporting.
• Water discharge quality data – temperature: CDP recognizes that discharge
quality data is rarely measured in organizations operating with wind, solar and
hydropower generation sources. In light of this:
o Organizations with more than 70% of their power generation coming from
these sources may select “Not relevant”.
o Organizations with less than 70% of their power generation coming from
these sources should select the response that best reflects their company’s
monitoring activity in their operations outside the hydropower, wind or solar
generation sources. Indicate in column 4 (Please explain) how the use of
these sources affects the proportion of sites monitored that you are
reporting.
• Water consumption – total volume: Water consumption in hydropower operations
includes evaporation from the reservoir surface as well as the balance between
withdrawals and discharges. Organizations should strive to estimate evaporated
volumes if they would result in an estimated error in their water balance of more
than 5%.
Sector-specific guidance for metals & mining and coal sectors
General
• This guidance is specific to companies responding to a metals & mining or coal
sector request. You should first read the guidance for this question that applies to
all companies. This is additional to the general guidance and does not replace it.
• Monitoring produced water volumes is common practice in the mining industry.
This information is requested as it indicates that an organization is striving for
comprehensive water accounting and aiming to manage all types of water entering
its company boundaries.
Water aspect (column 0)
• Water withdrawals – total volume: In line with CDP’s definition of water withdrawal,
for the mining industry water withdrawals include water diversions to enable
comparability – because it is water that crosses the company boundary.
153

• Water discharges – total volume: In line with CDP’s definition of water discharges,
for the mining industry sector discharges comprise all water outputs including water
diversions– because it is water that crosses the company boundary.
• Evaporation and water entrained in waste material should not be considered
discharges but as part of the consumption volumes.
• Water consumption – total volume: Organizations in the mining industry should
report on the volumes of water lost to evaporation from open water surfaces,
entrained in remaining waste material (such as tailings, coarse rejects, and
concentrates), or water stored over the reporting year.
• Water withdrawals - quality: This water aspect is particularly relevant for
companies with mining activities. Monitoring this parameter is in line with ICMM's
and WAF of the Mineral Council of Australia recommendation of monitoring the
quality of water. Companies with mining activities may select the appropriate
percentage.
• Water discharges - temperature: This water aspect is particularly relevant for
companies with metallurgy activities and smelters, who have cooling operations.
Companies with processing activities may select the appropriate percentage.
Sector-specific guidance for oil & gas sector
General
• This guidance is specific to companies responding to an oil & gas sector request.
You should first read the guidance for this question that applies to all companies.
This is additional to the general guidance and does not replace it.
• Monitoring produced water volumes is common practice in the oil & gas industry.
This information is requested as it indicates that an organization is striving for
comprehensive water accounting and aiming to manage all types of water entering
its company boundaries.
Water aspect (column 0)
• Water withdrawals – total volume: In the oil & gas sector, the reporting of water
withdrawals volumes typically does not include produced water. To enable
comparability, CDP requires all companies to include produced water volumes in
their withdrawals disclosure.
• Water discharges – total volume: In oil production, as part of secondary and
tertiary recovery operations, water-based fluids (from various sources) may be used
to maintain the pressure, and to displace the hydrocarbons and move them towards
the production wells. For CDP disclosure, organizations must consider these
volumes as part of their discharges to groundwater bodies in order to have an
accurate water balance.
• Produced water associated with your oil & gas sector activities - total volume:
Select “not applicable” only if your organization does not include an “upstream”
business division.
Explanation of • Boundaries of your organization: This term is key within CDP water accounting
terms
definitions and is a management boundary, rather than a physical boundary or a
legal entity. Water is considered to have crossed the boundary of your organization,
at either the corporate or site level, when your organization in any way uses it,
comes into contact with it, is required to manage it or when it becomes incorporated
154

into your products. It therefore includes any water use and management by your
organization outside of its physical corporate fence; for example, to provide a street
cleaning service or in fields remote from a processing plant. The scope of this
organizational boundary is defined by your chosen reporting boundary.
• Entrained water (Metals & mining and coal sectors only): In the mining industry,
entrained water refers to the volumes of water in the raw material.
• Measurement: The collection of quantified data for a water aspect - either as a
single volume/quality figure or an aggregation of volumes/ quality figures.
• Monitoring: This is the tracking of measurements over time, i.e. a trend or indication
of change in measured figures.
• Produced water (Oil & gas sector only): Water that is brought to the surface during
the production of hydrocarbons including formation water, flow-back water and
condensation water (IPIECA “Oil and gas industry guidance on voluntary
sustainability reporting”, 4th edition, 2020).
• Produced water: Water which enters the organization’s boundary as a result of the
extraction, processing, or use of any raw material, so that it must be managed by
the organization. When reporting to CDP, this water should not be counted as
recycled water when put to use within a single cycle of a business process.
Examples of produced water include moisture derived from vegetation such as in
sugar cane crushing and the water content in crude oil. (Note that companies with
oil and gas activities should refer to CDP’s sector specific guidance for this water
aspect).
• Safely managed WASH services: The universal provision of safely managed water,
sanitation, and hygiene services has dedicated targets within the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG 6.1 and 6.2). As a minimum, this disclosure refers to a
company’s tracking of its provision of drinking water for all workers, available when
needed and from sources compliant with faecal and chemical standards, as well as
sanitation facilities where excreta are safely disposed in situ or transported and
treated offsite.
• Water consumption: The amount of water drawn into the boundaries of the
organization (or facility) and not discharged back to the water environment or a third
party over the course of the reporting period.
• Water discharge quality – emissions to water (nitrates, phosphates, pesticides,
and/or other priority substances): This refers to the mass of any solid, liquid or
gaseous pollutants or contaminants, such as nitrates and pesticides, released to
bodies of water by your organization.
• Water discharge quality data – by standard effluent parameters: This refers to the
quality of your discharged water/effluents tracked according to parameters such as
Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), or Total
Suspended Solids (TSS). The specific choice of quality metrics will vary depending
on the organization’s products, services, and operations but should be consistent
with those used in the organization’s sector, and may need to vary depending on
national or regional regulations.
• Water discharge quality data – temperature: This refers to the temperature of your
discharged water/effluents. Though not yet a standard effluent parameter in many
industries, thermal pollution can play a significant role in ecosystem degradation by
altering levels of dissolved oxygen and harming wildlife.
• Water discharges – total volume(s): The sum of effluents and other water leaving
the organization’s boundary and released to surface water, groundwater water or to
third parties over the course of the reporting period.
155

• Water discharges – volumes by destination: This refers to the proportion of your
discharges that are tracked to different types of discharge destinations; e.g.
freshwater, brackish surface water/seawater, groundwater, or third parties.
• Water discharges – volumes by treatment method: This refers to the proportion of
your discharge that you track according to treatment method applied before being
returned to the environment - primary, secondary, or tertiary treatment types etc.
Different industries will have different requirements to meet compliance standards,
or a company may have an internal standard they adhere to.
• Water diversions (Metals & mining and coal sectors only): According to the Water
Accounting Framework from the Mineral Council of Australia water diversions are
flows from an input to an output without being utilized by the operational facility.
The flow is not stored with the intention of being used in a task or treated.
• Water recycled/reused (Oil & gas sector only): Water and wastewater (treated or
untreated) that has been used more than once, in order to reduce water
withdrawals. (Aligned with IPIECA’s Oil & gas industry guidance on voluntary
sustainability reporting 3rd ed. (2016).)
• Water recycled/reused: Water and wastewater (treated or untreated) used more
than once before being discharged from the organization’s boundary, so that water
demand is reduced. This may be in the same process (recycled), or in a different
process within the same facility or another of the organization’s facilities (reused). It
can include wastewater re-used from household processes such as washing dishes,
laundry, and bathing (grey water).
• Water withdrawals – total volume: The sum of all water drawn into the boundaries
of the organization (or facility) from all sources for any use over the course of the
reporting period. (Source: adapted from GRI Standards Glossary 2016).
• Water withdrawals – volumes by source: This refers to the proportion of
withdrawals that your organization can trace to different types of water withdrawal
source e.g. freshwater, brackish surface water/ seawater, produced water and third
party sources, and a breakdown of groundwater by renewable and non-renewable
sources.
• Water withdrawals quality: This refers to the quality of raw water that your
company draws into its boundary (from sources, such as rivers, lakes, groundwater
and coastal zones).

Additional The provision of safely managed WASH services at the workplace, and respecting the human
information rights to water and sanitation
The provision of safely managed WASH services at the workplace (and extending such
expectations to other actors within its value chain) is aligned with the aims of the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG 6.1 and 6.2) and the UN Human Rights Council endorsed Guiding
Principles on Business and Human Rights. These are established and authoritative global
reference points on how companies should respect human rights in their own activities and
business relationships, focusing on the risks to people rather than the risks to the business.
Provision requirements may also be linked to Health and Safety regulations applicable to
your operations.
In practice, companies need to implement due diligence to identify actual and potential
impacts on human rights and to prevent, mitigate, and remediate them. This could mean a
company may need to collaborate with others in the basin to reduce their collective water
use when withdrawals limit the water availability for local communities in a way that impacts
their right to water.
The Guide to Business and Human Rights (2014) published by the UK Equality and Human
Rights Commission states that a business can respect the right to a safe environment for
159

employees by ‘ensuring access to clean toilet facilities and drinking water’ amongst other
criteria.
The WASH Pledge provides resources for companies looking to implement WASH in the
workplace, including a reference for what represents best practice in providing WASH
services in different workplaces.
Guidance for companies on Integrating gender equality into water, sanitation and hygiene
projects is available from WaterAid.
Water withdrawals quality and GEMS
The UN Environment Global Environment Monitoring System for Freshwater
(GEMS/Water) provides the world community with sound data on water quality to support
scientific assessments and decision-making on the subject. Surface and groundwater quality
monitoring data collected from the global GEMS/Water monitoring network is shared
through the GEMStat information system.
Within UN Environment, GEMS/Water was identified as being the mechanism to support
countries/areas to fulfill their reporting obligations for the UN Sustainable Development
Goals. GEMS/Water provides appropriate support, based on capacity needs at national and
regional levels, and develops training for delivery in countries/areas all over the world.

(9.2.1) For your hydropower operations, what proportion of the following water aspects are regularly
measured and monitored?
Question text
Question dependencies This question only appears if you have any hydropower operations disclosed in 1.16.1
Change from last year
No change
Rationale Dam operation implies an alteration of the natural river flow and sediment movement.
Changes to river hydrology may affect instream and streamside habitats and affect local
biodiversity. Ensuring appropriate environmental flows and sediment loadings helps to
maintain water ecosystems and their basic functions.
Sediments can collect behind a dam because the dam itself is a physical barrier.
Eventually they can reduce the operative capacity of dams. When sediments collect,
ecosystems upstream and downstream can be affected.
CDP acknowledges that there is no universally accepted methodology for establishing
environmental flows. In their simplest form, they can include low- and high- water
regimes, and in their most complex, they may consider biodiversity and socioeconomic
160

factors. Environmental flows may be established in national, regional or local legislation
and there may be a legal requirement for hydropower operations to maintain those flows.
In many countries/areas, however, they are not legally established and organizations
looking to maintain environmental flows would need to rely on available literature or data.
This question allows organizations to demonstrate their leadership in evaluating the
environmental impacts of their operations, especially where legal and regulatory
frameworks in this area are weak.

Total Volumes
(9.2.2) What are the total volumes of water withdrawn, discharged, and consumed across all your
operations, how do they compare to the previous reporting year, and how are they forecasted to change?
Question details
Change from last year No change
Rationale This question incentivizes companies to have a complete view of their water balance at the
corporate level and to assess anticipated forward trends in water demand, encouraging a
transition towards business models which do not pose threats to rivers, lakes, aquifers, and
streams.
Total volumes can indicate the organization’s relative significance as a user of water and
provide a baseline figure for other calculations. Along with trend data, these volumes can also
suggest the level of risk posed by future disruptions to water supplies or increases in the cost
of water.
Water consumption measures water that is no longer available for use by the ecosystem or
local community in the reporting period. Reporting the volume of water consumption
contributes to an organization’s understanding of the overall scale of its impact due to water
withdrawal on downstream water availability.

Requested content Note: Organizations responding to an electric utilities, metals & mining, coal, or oil & gas sector
request should refer to additional sector-specific guidance on this question at the end of the
"Requested content” section.
General
• This question is asking you to report aggregated company-wide volumetric data. If you
do not have the aggregated data, if you are estimating or extrapolating to provide
complete coverage, give an explanation in column 6 (Please explain).
• Note that a zero should only be used for reporting zero volumes and not for an
absence of data.
• Please refer to CDP’s water accounting definitions before completing this question.
Report volumetric data in megaliters per year for the reporting year (the time period
you stated in response to 1.4). (1 megaliter = 1 million liters or 1,000 m3).
• Cooling water: Cooling water (freshwater or sea water) is often withdrawn in large
quantities and discharged back to its original source with negligible losses or variation
in quality. However, this should be included in your water accounts.
• Rainwater: If a company is managing rainwater (for example, by harvesting for use or
storage, or to prevent flooding), or is dependent on it for production of goods or the
delivery of services, it should try to estimate and disclose it as a withdrawal from the
hydrological system into the company boundary. Note that in some jurisdictions
rainwater is considered a withdrawal source and organizations are required to report its
collection and use.
o Companies may choose to exclude collected rainwater and domestic sewage
from their water withdrawal/discharge volumes only if the resulting error in
their water balance would be less than 5%. (This avoids your discharge
volumes being larger than your withdrawals).
o Including rainwater helps companies better understand their water
dependency and risks. For some companies, precipitation/rainwater volumes
may constitute a principal input of water at site level. This includes run-off
where it has to be managed. In these cases, excluding rainwater from water
accounting – withdrawal and discharge - would not be a true reflection of site
water balance. In addition, there may be reduced impacts from using rainwater
in place of other local freshwater sources.
Volumes (megaliters/year) (column 1)
• Report volumetric data in megaliters per year for the reporting year (the time period you
stated in response to 1.4). (1 megaliter = 1 million liters or 1000 m3).
164

• For withdrawals, data may be collected from several sources, including water meters,
water bills, calculations derived from other available water data or the organization’s
own estimates (if neither water meters, nor bills, or reference data exist).
• Before deciding whether your withdrawals, discharges or consumption can be reported
as zero (0), please refer to CDP’s Technical Note on Water Accounting Definitions.
• If reporting “zero consumption”, remember to check your discharge volumes. Scorers
will check that discharge and withdrawals volumes balance (approximately).
Comparison with previous reporting year / Five-year forecast (columns 2, 4)
• CDP does not define the threshold for considering a value as “much higher” rather than
simply “higher” (or “much lower”/”lower”). CDP requests this information from many
different industries with huge variations in water use, and it would therefore be difficult
to provide a universal threshold that is meaningful (as proportions will equate to
different absolute values and impacts).
• CDP recommends that you define your own threshold for what is “much higher” (and
“much lower”) and apply it consistently so that the reported data for this question is
comparable and data users can track your water accounts more effectively each year.
A company-specific explanation for these thresholds should be provided in column 6
(Please explain).
• The threshold defined for “much higher”/”higher” (and “much lower”/”lower”) should be
the same for column 2 and column 4.
• Comparison with previous reporting year: If the data was not previously reported, but
was collected, you may choose to indicate a comparison with the previous year or
select "This is our first year of measurement". In either case, use the “Please explain”
column to provide details about the information reported.
Primary reason for comparison with previous reporting year / Primary reason for forecast (columns
3, 5)
• Select the most significant reason.
• ‘Maximum potential volume reduction already achieved’ refers to situations where
water saving limits have been reached – for example where a closed-loop water
recycling system has been put in place and further water reductions are not feasible.
Please explain (column 6)
• Include any contextual information necessary to understand your primary reason for
the comparison with previous reporting year and the five-year forecast, and how the
volumetric data have been compiled, such as any standards, methodologies, and
assumptions used.
• If you have left column 1 blank because you do not have the data, describe the barriers
to reporting that data and any plans to collect and report it.
• Describe the thresholds for what is “much higher” and “much lower” for the change in
volumes from previous reporting year and the five-year forecasts.
• If you provide an estimated figure or there is any level of uncertainty in your “Total”
figures in column 1, you should explain this in this field and give the range of
uncertainty. Uncertainty can arise from data gaps, assumptions,
metering/measurement constraints including equipment accuracy, data management,
etc.
• Note: CDP expects withdrawals, discharges and consumption figures to balance
(approximately; +/- 5%) so if there is a good reason why this cannot happen, it should
be explained in the "Total consumption" row.
Please explain – additional guidance for consumption volume (row 3)
165

• For the “water consumption” row, you should indicate if your figure is based on an
aggregation of local measurements, an aggregation of local calculations, or is a
company-wide calculation (for example using withdrawals minus discharges).
• If known, please provide a breakdown of this figure (with reference to CDP’s definition
of consumption) and a brief explanation. Breakdowns include:
o Volume incorporated into products, crops or waste;
o Volume evaporated or transpired;
o Volume consumed by humans or livestock;
o Net volume stored in a controlled manner;
o Net volume stored for future use;
o Volumes otherwise excluded from discharges out of the organization’s
boundary.
• It is important that you explain a negative consumption figure where this is the case.
This would indicate that your discharges are larger than your withdrawals for the
reporting year - due to a net release of water from storage, for example.
Requested content – Sector-specific guidance for electric utilities sector
[Sector] (if applicable)
General
• This guidance is specific to companies responding to an electric utilities sector
request. You should first read the guidance for this question that applies to all
companies. This is additional to the general guidance and does not replace it.
Water aspect (column 0)
• Total withdrawals: CDP recognizes the difficulty in accounting for some elements of
the hydropower operations’ water balance, specifically surface runoff or elements that
are outside the organization’s control such as third-party discharges into the
reservoir. Water withdrawals into hydropower operations include river inflow, surface
runoff and precipitation onto the reservoir surface, as well as third-party discharges
into the reservoir:
W = Precipitation + River Inflow + Runoff + Third-party discharges into reservoir
Organizations should strive to include volumes for those sources if they would result in an
estimated error in the water balance of more than 5% and take a consistent approach
throughout the questionnaire. In column 6 (Please explain), you should explain which
sources you have included or excluded. Note that estimation or modelling are valid
sources of data.
• Total discharges: CDP recognizes the difficulty in accounting for some elements of the
hydropower operations’ water balance, specifically seepage or those that are outside
the organization’s control such as third-party withdrawals.
In hydropower operations, water discharge includes the dam outlet and the spillway,
underground seepage and third-party withdrawals from the reservoir (for example a
municipal water plant abstracting from the reservoir).
D = Dam outlet + Spillway + Seepage + Third-party withdrawals from the reservoir
Organizations should strive to include volumes for those destinations and explain which of
these elements are included or excluded if they would result in an estimated error in the
water balance of more than 5%. In column 6, you should explain which destinations you
have included or excluded and take a consistent approach throughout the questionnaire.
Note that estimation or modelling are valid sources of data.
• Total consumption: Water consumption in hydropower operations includes
evaporation from the reservoir surface as well as the balance between withdrawals and
166

discharges. Although organizations should estimate evaporated volumes if they would
result in an estimated error in the water balance of more than 5%, you may consider
variations in storage as a valid measure of your consumption volumes rather than
calculating evaporation and the balance between all withdrawals and discharges. This
information is usually easily derived from water level measurements.
In column 6 (Please explain) provide your approach to reporting a total consumption figure.
Please explain (column 6)
• In the case of hydropower operations, indicate which elements of water withdrawals
(river inflow, surface runoff, precipitation onto the reservoir surface and third-party
discharges into the reservoir), discharges (spillway, underground seepage, and third-
party withdrawals from the reservoir) and consumption are you taking into account
when providing your response to column 1 (Volume). You may indicate the method
followed to obtain it, e.g. direct monitoring, estimation from a hydrological model, or
other secondary source of information.
• Additionally, you may choose to specify the evaporated volumes if your organization
collects this data.
• Note: CDP expects withdrawals, discharges and consumption figures to balance
(approximately; +/- 5%) so if there is a good reason why this cannot happen, it should
be explained in the "Total consumption" row.
Sector-specific guidance for metals & mining and coal sectors
General
• This guidance is specific to companies responding to a metals & mining or coal sector
request. You should first read the guidance for this question that applies to all
companies. This is additional to the general guidance and does not replace it.
Water aspect (column 0)
• Water withdrawals: In line with CDP’s definition of water withdrawal, for the mining
industry water withdrawals include water diversions to enable comparability – because
it is water that crosses the company boundary.
• Water discharges: In line with CDP’s definition of water discharges, for the mining
industry discharges comprise all water outputs including water diversions – because it
is water that crosses the company boundary. Evaporation and water entrained in waste
material should not be considered discharges but as part of the consumption
volumes.
• Water consumption: Water consumption in the mining industry should report on the
volumes of water lost to evaporation from open water surfaces, entrained in remaining
waste material (such as tailings, coarse rejects, and concentrates), or water stored over
the reporting year.
Sector-specific guidance for oil & gas sector
General
• This guidance is specific to companies responding to an oil & gas sector request. You
should first read the guidance for this question that applies to all companies. This is
additional to the general guidance and does not replace it.
Water aspect (column 0)
• Total withdrawals: In the oil & gas sector, the reporting of water withdrawals volumes
typically does not include produced water. To enable comparability, CDP requires all
167

companies to include produced water volumes in their withdrawals disclosure, in order
to have an accurate water balance.
• As part of groundwater withdrawal volumes (be it from renewable or non-renewable
sources), organizations should include all withdrawals from aquifers (other than the
formation being exploited). These withdrawals may be intended for any use in the
organization, including injection to maintain well pressure or as part of the fracture
fluids.
• Total discharges: In oil production, as part of secondary and tertiary recovery
operations, water-based fluids (from various sources) may be used to maintain the
pressure, and to displace the hydrocarbons and move them towards the production
wells. For CDP disclosure, organizations must report these volumes as discharges to
groundwater bodies, to enable comparability and have an accurate water balance.
Explanation of terms • Water balance: An account of the volumes of water flowing into and leaving an
organization across its boundary. When the two volumes are equal, the net water
balance will be zero.
• Water consumption: The amount of water that is drawn into the boundaries of the
organization (or facility) and not discharged back to the water environment or a third
party over the course of the reporting period. It is important to distinguish the term
‘consumption’ from the term ‘water withdrawal’ or ‘water use’. Water consumed is
water that during the reporting year:
o has been incorporated into products, crops or waste
o has evaporated or transpired
o consumed by humans or livestock
o has been stored in a controlled manner because it is polluted to the point of
being unusable by other users, and so that it does not leave the organization’s
boundary
o has been stored during the reporting year for use or discharge in a subsequent
reporting period
o is otherwise excluded from discharges out of the organization’s boundary so
that it is no longer available for use by the ecosystem or local community.
Consumption may be measured directly or modelled, or it can be calculated by
subtracting the total water discharge from company boundary from total water
withdrawn into the company boundary during the reporting period. As CDP data users
require comparability, all disclosing companies should use this method.
If the company discharges more water than it withdraws, for example, because it has
used and then discharged previously stored water, a negative consumption value is
possible. This would indicate a net contribution to the water environment in the
reporting year.
• Water discharges – total volume(s): The sum of effluents and other water leaving the
organization’s boundary and released to surface water, groundwater water or to third
parties over the course of the reporting period. This includes all water leaving the
company boundary, whether it is:

o released through a defined discharge point (point source discharge), or
o released over land in a dispersed or undefined manner (non-point source
discharge), or as

Water discharge can be authorized (in accordance with discharge consent) or
unauthorized (if discharge consent is exceeded).
• Water diversions (Metals & mining and coal sectors only): According to the Water
Accounting Framework from the Mineral Council of Australia water diversions are
flows from an input to an output without being utilized by the operational facility. The
flow is not stored with the intention of being used in a task or treated.

Rationale This question incentivizes companies to have a complete view of their water balance at the
business division level and to assess anticipated forward trends in water demand,
encouraging a transition towards business models which do not pose threats to rivers,
lakes, aquifers, and streams. Volumes of water withdrawals, discharges, and consumption
typically differ significantly between business divisions. Detailing the water balance at this
scale provides data users with an understanding of the key phases that determine the
organization’s water balance and allow a better interpretation of answers provided in other

Requested content General
• IPIECA’s “Oil and gas industry guidance on voluntary sustainability reporting”
guidelines recommend reporting in m3. However, due to the large volumes of water
involved in the oil & gas industry, and to allow for comparability, CDP’s preferred
metric is megaliters (1 megaliter = 1 million liters or 1000 m3)..
• If you are estimating or extrapolating to provide complete coverage, please give an
explanation in column 6 (“Please explain”).
• Note that a zero should only be used for reporting zero volumes and not for an
absence of data.
• In the case of integrated plants combining one or more business divisions
organizations may choose to report the withdrawn, discharged, and consumption
volumes in either one of the business division rows. You should then clarify this in
column 6 (“Please explain”).
• Total withdrawals - Upstream (row 1): In the oil & gas sector, the reporting of water
withdrawals volumes typically does not include produced water. To enable
comparability, CDP requires all companies to include produced water volumes in their
withdrawals disclosure, in order to have an accurate water balance.
• Total discharges – Upstream (row 2): In oil production, as part of secondary and
tertiary recovery operations, water-based fluids (from various sources) may be used
to maintain the pressure, and to displace the hydrocarbons and move them towards
the production wells. For CDP disclosure, organizations must report these volumes
as discharges to groundwater bodies, to enable comparability and have an accurate
water balance.
Comparison with previous reporting year / Five-year forecast (columns 2, 4):
• If you left column 1 blank because you are unable to report a calculated or estimate
figure this year, you may give an estimate for the change if possible.
• CDP does not define the threshold for considering a value as “much higher” rather
than simply “higher” (or “much lower”/“lower”). CDP requests this information from
many different industries with huge variations in water use, and it would therefore be
difficult to provide a universal threshold that is meaningful (as proportions will equate
to different absolute values and impacts).
• CDP recommends that you define your own threshold for what is “much higher” (and
“much lower”) and apply it consistently so that each year the reported data for this
question is comparable and data users can track your water accounts more
effectively. A company-specific explanation for these thresholds should be provided
in column 6 (Please explain).
• The threshold defined for “much higher”/ “higher” (and “much lower”/ “lower”) should
be the same for column 2 and column 4.
• Comparison with previous reporting year: If the data was not previously reported,
but was collected, you may choose to indicate a comparison with the previous year or
select "This is our first year of measurement". In either case, use the “Please explain”
column to provide details about the information reported.
Primary reason for comparison with previous reporting year / Primary reason for forecast (columns
3, 5)
• Select the most significant reason.
173

• “Maximum potential volume reduction already achieved” refers to situations where
water saving limits have been reached – for example where a closed-loop water
recycling system has been put in place and further water reductions are not feasible.
Please explain (column 6):
• If you have reported combined data for business divisions, please explain your
approach here.
• Briefly explain your response for column 1 including any zero (0) volumes.
• Describe the thresholds for what is “much higher” and “much lower” for the change in
volumes from the previous reporting year and the five-year forecasts.
• Include any contextual information necessary to understand your primary reason for
the comparison with previous reporting year and the five-year forecast.

Withdrawals from water stressed areas
(9.2.4) Indicate whether water is withdrawn from areas with water stress, provide the volume, how it
compares with the previous reporting year, and how it is forecasted to change.
Question text
Change from last Modified guidance
year
Rationale Since water is a shared resource, and water-related impacts are localized, organizations are
increasingly encouraged to prioritize action in areas with water stress and to understand and
respond to local contexts.
This question on water from stressed areas supports a trend towards metrics for corporate
water reporting and target setting informed by local context, and in addition, the TCFD
recommends disclosure of reliance on water from areas of water stress. This question also
incentivizes organizations to assess anticipated forward trends in withdrawals from water
stressed areas, encouraging a transition towards business models which do not pose threats
to rivers, lakes, aquifers, and streams.
The data requested assists the assessment of your organization’s dependence on potentially
contested sources (regardless of whether your facility itself is located in a stressed area), as
well as your potential impact on sensitive locations.
174

Water stress is a driver of business risk and, as stress is likely to worsen, transparency is
critical. Understanding elevated business risk due to operations in water stressed areas is
important for the investor community, and this question allows data users to review the trend
in dependency on water from stressed basins.
Knowledge of water-related hot spots helps your organization identify where water stress
may be affecting its operations, now or in the future, as well as to prioritize your sustainable
water management practices.

Requested content General
• Refer to CDP’s water accounting definitions and the Explanation of terms for this
question before completing the table.
• Organizations should report which approach/tool they use to assess whether their
withdrawals are from a “stressed area”. They should explain the approach taken and
which data sets were used to assess “water stress”.
• As good practice, a water-stressed area should be measured, at the catchment level
as a minimum.
• Credible, publicly available tools for assessing levels of water stress include WRI
Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, WWF Water Risk Filter, (see Additional information for more
details about these tools).
• Commonly accepted global risk indicators to assess areas as water stressed in
terms of quantity and their thresholds for reporting to CDP include:
o Water availability - greater than ‘High risk’: 3.4 (WWF Water Risk Filter).
WWF recommends that users also take into consideration ‘Medium risk’:
>2.6.
§ The WWF Water Risk Filter’s risk category ‘Water Availability’
integrates the State of Nature layer for Water Availability
recommended for the Science-based Targets for Nature (SBTN) Step
1: Assess and Step 2: Interpret & Prioritize. The SBTN’s State of
Nature layer for Water Availability is calculated based on a multi-
model approach which integrates the best available global water
scarcity risk indicators: Water depletion, Baseline water stress, and
Blue water scarcity. In addition, WWF has incorporated an indicator
176

on groundwater availability in the WWF Water Risk Filter’s risk
category ‘Water Availability’.
§ WWF recommends using the ‘Drought’ risk category as
supplementary information to help in interpreting results and
prioritizing sites in water stressed areas, as droughts can exacerbate
water stress/water availability.
o Baseline water stress - equal to/greater than ‘High’: 40-80% (WRI Aqueduct
Water Risk Atlas). This refers to the ratio of total annual water withdrawals to
available renewable water supply.
o Baseline water depletion - equal to/greater than ‘High’: 50-75% (WRI
Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas). This refers to the ratio of total annual water
consumption to available renewable water supply
• Organizations can complement the results of these tools with their own
assessments or by using other methodologies. Some companies will use more
granular level data and local knowledge of the basins in which they operate to assess
which withdrawals are from stressed areas. For example, an organization may
consider its facility to be in a water-stressed sub basin or other smaller geographic
level, though a global data set suggests that the particular catchment is not stressed.
• Many national and regional water authorities will also have suitable maps, databases
and environmental assessments available. (These may be included in the
FAO/AquaStat database, or in reports of progress against SDG 6.4.2.)
• Note that this question asks about the location of withdrawal sources rather than
your facilities. In most cases, these will not be different at a catchment level. If
supplying data based on the location of facilities because the exact location of
withdrawal sources is unknown, indicate this in column 9 “Please explain”.
Withdrawals are from areas with water stress (column 1)
• If you select “No”, columns 2 “Volume withdrawn from areas with water stress
(megaliters)” to 7 “% of total withdrawals that are withdrawn from areas of water
stress” will not be presented.
• If you select “Unknown”, columns 2 “Volume withdrawn from areas with water stress
(megaliters)” to 8 “Identification tool” will not be presented.
Volume withdrawn from areas with water stress (megaliters) (column 2)
• Your disclosure should include all withdrawals within stressed areas and all sources
listed in 9.2.7, including third party suppliers. Do not include produced water or
desalinated water.
• Report volumetric data in megaliters per year for the reporting year (1 megaliter = 1
million liters or 1,000m3). You may provide an estimate and explain why in column 9
“Please explain”.
• Note that a zero should only be used for reporting zero volumes and not for an
absence of data.
Comparison with previous reporting year / Five-year forecast (columns 3, 5)
• CDP does not define the threshold for considering a value as “much higher” rather
than simply “higher” (or “much lower” / “lower”). CDP requests this information from
many different industries with huge variations in water use, and it would therefore be
difficult to provide a universal threshold that is meaningful (as proportions will equate
to different absolute values and impacts). CDP recommends that you define your
own threshold for what is “much higher” (and “much lower”) and apply it consistently
so that each year the reported data for this question is comparable and data users
177

can track your water accounts more effectively. A company-specific explanation for
these thresholds should be provided in column 9 “Please explain”.
• The threshold defined for “much higher” / “higher” (and “much lower” / “lower”) should
be the same for column 3 “Comparison with previous reporting year” and column 5
“Five-year forecast”.
• Comparison with previous reporting year: If the data was not previously reported, but
was collected, you may choose to indicate a comparison with the previous year or
select “This is our first year of measurement”. In either case, use the “Please explain”
column to provide details about the information reported.
• In some cases, the “Comparison with previous reporting year” for the % withdrawn
from areas with water stress may be different to the net change in volume withdrawn
from water stressed areas compared to the previous reporting year. In these cases,
the organization should state the volumetric comparison between the current and
previous reporting year in column 9 “Please explain”. This would be applicable, for
example, when an organization has “much higher” total company-wide withdrawals
compared to the previous reporting year, but their absolute withdrawals from areas
with water stress are about the same or higher. In this example, the response to
column 3 “Comparison with previous reporting year” would be “lower” although their
absolute withdrawals from areas with water stress have not been reduced.
Primary reason for comparison with previous reporting year / Primary reason for forecast (columns
4, 6)
• Select the most significant reason.
• “Maximum potential volume reduction already achieved” refers to situations where
water saving limits have been reached – for example where a closed-loop water
recycling system has been put in place and further water reductions are not feasible.
% of total withdrawals that are withdrawn from areas with water stress (column 7)
• This column will be auto-calculated in the disclosure platform.
• The % of total withdrawals from areas with water stress will be calculated using the
volume withdrawn from areas with water stress figure (column 2) and the volume of
total withdrawals figure given in 9.2.2 (column 1, row 1). Ensure that you have
entered data into these columns.

Identification tool (column 8)
• Select the tool(s) your organization uses to identify whether its withdrawals are
located in geographic areas of water stress.
• If you have responded ”No” to column 1 “Withdrawals are from areas with water
stress”, select the tool(s) your organization used to determine that you do not
withdraw from geographic areas of water stress.
• If you have used a different tool, methodology or data set, select “Other, please
specify” and provide a label for the tool/approach in the text field provided and give
details in column 9 “Please explain”.
Please explain (column 9)
• If you have used an estimate, you may provide an explanation why.
• Use this field to give more details about:
o The volume you reported in column 2 “Volume withdrawn from areas with
water stress (megaliters)”
178

o Any exclusions in your reporting
o Scope of assessments (full coverage or partial based on geographies,
business units, etc.)
• If your responses to columns 2, 3 or 5 are partially or wholly estimated, explain your
approach to estimation.
• If you have selected a recommended tool in column 8 “Identification tool”, briefly
describe how the selected tool was applied to evaluate whether water is withdrawn
from stressed areas, including:
o Which data sets are used; and
o Frequency of assessments.
• If you have not used one of the tools recommended, briefly describe:
o The tool used;
o How “areas with water stress” are defined and identified, including the
threshold applied; and
o If possible, the methodology used such as the data sets that your
assessment is based on.
• This question asks about the location of withdrawal sources rather than your
facilities. Indicate if you are only able to supply data based on the location of facilities
and give your reason.
• You may explain your organizations management response to the exposure to
business risks associated with the volume disclosed in column 2 “Volume withdrawn
from areas with water stress (megaliters)”, and your experience of working in water
stressed areas. This is optional but may provide data users with context to better
interpret the significance of the figures reported.
• If you selected “Unknown” in column 1“Withdrawals are from areas with water
stress”, explain why you have not assessed if any of your water withdrawals are from
stressed areas, and if relevant, any plans for future assessment.
Explanation of terms • Blue water scarcity: the ratio of the blue water footprint to the total blue water availability,
considering intra-annual variability. In the WWF Water Risk Filter’s risk category ‘Water
Availability’, blue water scarcity risk indicator is classified into 5 risk levels, including where
available blue water has been fully consumed (‘Medium risk’), or environmental flow
requirements are not met (‘High’ to ‘Very High risk’).
• Water stress (‘areas with’): a concept that considers physical quantity aspects related to
water resources, including water availability. As good practice, a water stressed area
should be measured at the catchment level as a minimum. Commonly accepted global
indicators to assess areas as water stressed and their thresholds for reporting to CDP
include:
o Water availability – category greater than ‘High risk’: 3.4 (WWF Water Risk Filter).
WWF recommends that users also take into consideration ‘Medium risk’: >2.6. This
category is based on a multi-model approach which integrates the best available
global water scarcity risk indicators: water depletion, baseline water stress, and
blue water scarcity.
o Baseline water stress – indicator equal to/greater than ‘High’: 40-80% (WRI
Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas). This refers to the ratio of total annual water
withdrawals to available renewable water supply.
o Baseline water depletion – indicator equal to/greater than ‘High’: 50-75% (WRI
Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas). This refers to the ratio of total annual water
consumption to available renewable water supply.

Risk indicator Description
Baseline water stress = A customizable global atlas used to evaluate how water risk (and water stress) may
withdrawals as a affect operations (at watershed level). The global map can be tailored specifically for
percentage of available flow nine water-intense industry sectors including Oil & Gas, Agriculture and Chemicals.
Note that the categories of “Overall water risk” are based on a weighted selection of
Baseline water depletion = various physical, regulatory and reputational indicators. One of the “Physical risk
consumption as a quantity” indicators is a water stress indicator (“Baseline water stress”’) and another
percentage of available flow is a water depletion indicator (“Baseline water depletion”). The Aqueduct interface
allows users to easily change the settings so that just particular indicators are
shown. “The Baseline water stress” and “Baseline water depletion” indicators are
based on a global dataset developed by the World Resources Institute and are also
available as risk indicators in the WWF Water Risk Filter.
For CDP disclosure, companies using Aqueduct should consider areas as “water
stressed” where baseline water stress equals or exceeds 40%, or baseline water
depletion equals or exceeds 50%.

considering intra-annual Nature (SBTN) Step 1: Assess and Step 2: Interpret & Prioritize. The SBTN’s State of
variability Nature layer for Water Availability is calculated based on a multi-model approach
which integrates the best available global water scarcity risk indicators: Water
Groundwater = The depletion, Baseline water stress, and Blue water scarcity. In addition, WWF has
variation in groundwater incorporated an indicator on groundwater availability in the WWF Water Risk Filter’s
levels over time in mm risk category ‘Water Availability’.
As every global water availability dataset is based on models using different
assumptions and limitations, WWF recommends using the WWF Water Risk Filter
risk category “Water Availability” – which integrates multiple, reliable, peer-reviewed
global datasets for a robust assessment of water availability at a global scale.
Furthermore, WWF recommends using the ‘Drought’ risk category in the WWF Water
Risk Filter as supplementary information to help in interpreting results and
prioritizing sites in water stressed areas, as droughts can exacerbate water
stress/water availability.

Change from last No change
year
Rationale Distinguishing between source types and reporting volume of water withdrawn by source
contributes to an understanding of the potential risks and impacts associated with an
organization’s water use as this level of detail can be significant. For example, withdrawing water
from an overdrawn aquifer will have different consequences for local water stress and a
company’s water security than does withdrawing seawater. Clean freshwater is becoming
increasingly scarce, and this can impact production processes that rely on large volumes of
water.
In regions where water sources are highly restricted, the organization’s water consumption
patterns can also influence relations with other stakeholders.

Requested content Note: Organizations responding to an electric utilities, metals & mining, or coal sector request
should refer to additional sector-specific guidance on this question at the end of the "Requested
content” section.
General
• For the different sources, this question is requesting a figure for aggregated withdrawal
volumes from across your organization. Information about your withdrawals by their
source allows a better understanding of your company’s dependency on different
sources, the trend in that dependency, and your risk exposure from different water
sources. If you do not have aggregated company-wide volumetric data, you may
provide an estimate and give an explanation in column 5 (Please explain).
• Cooling water: Cooling water (freshwater or sea water) is often withdrawn in large
quantities and discharged back to its original source with negligible losses or variation
in quality. However, this should be included in your water accounts. For example, a
utility company may use large volumes of surface water for cooling purposes, and the
water quality may not need to be fresh. Companies should report this information by
185

selecting ‘Brackish surface water/seawater’, to demonstrate to investors that they are
not dependent on potentially scarce fresh surface water sources and therefore their
risk exposure is likely to be less than if they were dependent on freshwater resources.
• Rainwater: If a company is managing rainwater (for example, by harvesting for use or
storage, or to prevent flooding) or is dependent on it for production of goods or the
delivery of services, it should try to estimate and disclose it as a withdrawal from the
hydrological system into the company boundary.
o Companies may choose to exclude collected rainwater and domestic sewage
from their water withdrawal/discharge volumes only if this would result in less
than 5% error in their water balance.
o Including rainwater helps companies better understand their water
dependency and risks. For some companies, precipitation/rainwater volumes
may constitute a principal input of water at site level. In these cases, excluding
rainwater from water accounting – withdrawal and discharge - would not be a
true reflection of site water balance. In addition, there may be reduced impacts
from using rainwater in place of other local freshwater sources.
• Oil & gas sector only: Groundwater - As part of groundwater withdrawal volumes (be it
from renewable or non-renewable sources), organizations should include all
withdrawals from aquifers (other than the formation being exploited). These
withdrawals may be intended for any use in the organization, including injection to
maintain well pressure or as part of the fracture fluids.
Source (column 0)
• Fresh surface water: For the purposes of this disclosure you should include all surface
water sources of a higher quality than brackish (i.e. a TDS lower than 10,000 mg/l).
Relevance (column 1)
Select:
• ‘Relevant’ if your company uses, has used or plans to use the source, even if the
withdrawal is zero for this reporting year.
• ‘Relevant but volume unknown’ if your company uses, has used or plans to use the
source, but the volume for this year is unknown and cannot be estimated. Columns 2, 3
and 4 will then be disabled and you should provide further explanation in column 5
(Please explain).
• ‘Not relevant’ if your company does not withdraw from the source. Columns 2, 3 and 4
will then be disabled. You may provide further explanation in column 5 (Please explain).
Volume (megaliters/year) (column 2)
• Volumes should be reported in megaliters per year (1 megaliter = 1 million liters or
1000 m3). Your reporting year is the time period you stated in response to question
1.4.
• If you do have volumetric data for the current reporting year you may provide an
estimate and explain why this is the case in column 5.
• Note that a zero (0) should only be used for reporting zero volumes and not for an
absence of data.
• If reporting zero withdrawals, provide an explanation in column 5. Before deciding
whether your withdrawals should be reported as “zero”, please refer to CDP’s definition
of water withdrawals.
Comparison with previous reporting year (column 3)
• CDP does not define the threshold for considering a value as ‘much higher’ rather than
simply ‘higher’ (or ‘much lower’/’lower’). CDP requests this information from many
different industries with huge variations in water use, and it would therefore be difficult
186

to provide a universal threshold that is meaningful (as proportions will equate to
different absolute values and impacts).
• CDP recommends that you define your own threshold for what is ‘much higher’ (and
‘much lower’) and apply it consistently so that each year the reported data for this
question is comparable and data users can track your water accounts more effectively.
A company-specific explanation for these thresholds should be provided in column 5
for each source.
• If the data was not previously reported, but was collected, you may choose to indicate a
comparison with the previous year or select "This is our first year of measurement". In
either case, use the “Please explain” column to provide details about the information
reported.
Primary reason for comparison with previous reporting year (column 4)
• Select the most significant reason for the comparison with previous reporting year.
o ‘Maximum potential volume reduction already achieved’ refers to situations
where water saving limits have been reached – for example where a closed-
loop water recycling system has been put in place and further water reductions
are not feasible.
Please explain (column 5)
• To assist CDP data users to understand a company’s water use, you should explain
your selections for ‘Relevance’ (column 1) and ‘Primary reason for comparison with
previous reporting year’ (column 4), including any company-specific contextual
information.
• Report whether your volumes for each source are estimated, modelled, or sourced from
direct measurements. If estimation or modelling has been used, report the estimation
or modelling methods.
• Please explain any zero volumes for relevant sources. For example, “we sometimes
withdraw water from this source but the volume for the reporting year was zero”.
• Describe the thresholds for what is ‘much higher’ and ‘much lower’ for the change in
volumes compared to the previous reporting year.
• Indicate the anticipated future trends for these volumes, if known (note that future
trends would be at least one year after the end of the reporting year provided in 1.4).
• For “Fresh surface water” (row 1), it is important that you state which of the sources
apply (rainwater, water from wetlands, rivers and lakes etc.). Also state whether those
sources are monitored and if you know whether the withdrawal volume for each source
is increasing or decreasing. If you are using and managing rainwater and the volume
equates to more than 5% of your water balance, please explain if it is harvested, treated
etc. and the benefits and impacts of using it.
• For ‘Third party’ (row 6), if possible, specify whether the third party is a municipal
supplier or another type of third party organization. This is particularly important if the
third party is known to be located in a water stressed area.
Requested content – Sector-specific guidance for electric utilities sector
Sector-specific
General
• This guidance is specific to companies responding to an electric utilities sector request.
You should first read the guidance for this question that applies to all companies. This
is additional to the general guidance and does not replace it.
• CDP recognizes the difficulty in accounting for some elements of the hydropower
operations’ water balance, specifically surface runoff or elements that are outside the
organization’s control such as third-party discharges into the reservoir (for example a
municipal waste water treatment plant discharging into the reservoir).
187

• Water withdrawals into hydropower operations include river inflow, surface runoff and
precipitation onto the reservoir surface, as well as third-party discharges into the
reservoir:
W = Precipitation + River Inflow + Runoff + Third-party discharges into reservoir
• Organizations should strive to include volumes for those sources if they would result in
an estimated error in their water balance of more than 5% (specifically the total water
withdrawals figure you report in 9.2.2) and take a consistent approach throughout the
questionnaire. In the last column (Please explain) you should indicate which sources
you have included or excluded. Note that estimation or modelling are valid sources of
data.
Relevance (column 1)
• For your hydropower operations - if the data for third-party discharges to the reservoir
or the surface runoff volumes are not available, you may select “Relevant but volume
unknown” or “Not relevant” depending on which best applies to your organization. You
may consider water volumes to be relevant if the resulting error in the organization’s
water balance would be more than 5%.
Please explain (column 5)
• Indicate which elements of water withdrawals (river inflow, surface runoff, precipitation
onto the reservoir surface or third-party discharges into the reservoir), are you taking
into account when providing your response, as well as the method followed to obtain it,
e.g. direct monitoring, estimation from a hydrological model, or other secondary source
of information.
Sector-specific guidance for metals & mining and coal sectors
General
• This guidance is specific to companies responding to a metals & mining or coal sector
request. You should first read the guidance for this question that applies to all
companies. This is additional to the general guidance and does not replace it.
Source (column 0)
• Rainwater: Please note that in the mining industry precipitation/rainwater volumes
may constitute a principal input of water at site level. Excluding rainwater from water
accounting would not be a true reflection of site water balance.
• Groundwater: Groundwater withdrawals are linked to extraction from bore holes and
aquifer interception, i.e. groundwater is water that is extracted as part of ore body
dewatering during mining operations. Water entrained in ore should be reported as
produced water.
• Brackish water/seawater: Organizations sourcing freshwater of low water quality
(categories 2 and 3 of the Water Accounting Framework from the Mineral Council of
Australia) and using it in their operations without significant treatment may report these
resources as part of row 3 “Brackish water/seawater” sources, despite being a different
type of resource.
• Produced/Entrained water: Water entrained in ore should be reported in this row.
Please explain (column 5)
• You may provide additional information to describe your organization’s water use.
Consider providing an explanation of factors like local landscape, geology, climate or
hydrogeology, commodity type, or ore grade.
188

Explanation of terms • Brackish surface water/seawater: Surface water in which the concentration of salts is
high and far exceeds normally acceptable standards for municipal, domestic or
irrigation use (at least higher than 10,000 mg/l TDS). Seawater has a typical
concentration of salts above 35,000 mg/l TDS.
• Fresh surface water, including rainwater, water from wetlands, rivers and lakes:
Water that is naturally occurring water on the Earth's surface in ice sheets, ice caps,
glaciers, icebergs, bogs, ponds, lakes, rivers and streams, and has a low concentration
of dissolved solids. For the purposes of reporting water accounting data to CDP, this
surface water source includes water of a quality generally acceptable for, or requiring
minimal treatment to be acceptable for, domestic, municipal or agricultural uses (at
least <10,000 mg/l TDS, though a range of additional quality properties may also be
considered). ‘High quality’ fresh water sources considered acceptable for potable use
are typically characterized as having concentrations of dissolved solids less than 1,000
mg/l.
• Groundwater (non-renewable): Water which is being held in, and can be recovered
from, an underground formation. Non-renewable groundwater has a negligible rate of
natural recharge on the human time-scale (more than 50 years), and is generally
located at deeper depths than renewable groundwater. This is sometimes referred to
as “fossil” water.
• Groundwater (renewable): Water which is being held in, and can be recovered from, an
underground formation. Renewable groundwater sources can be replenished within 50
years and are usually located at shallow depths.
• Produced water: Water which enters the organization’s boundary as a result of the
extraction, processing, or use of any raw material, so that it must be managed by the
organization. When reporting to CDP, this water should not be counted as recycled
water when put to use within a single cycle of a business process. Examples of
produced water include moisture derived from vegetation such as in sugar cane
crushing and the water content in crude oil. (Note that companies with oil and gas
activities should refer to CDP’s sector specific guidance for this water aspect).
• Produced water (Oil & gas sector only): water that is brought to the surface during the
production of hydrocarbons including formation water, flow-back water and
condensation water (IPIECA “Oil and gas industry guidance on voluntary sustainability
reporting”, 4th edition, 2020
• Third party sources: This includes water provided by municipal water suppliers, public
or private utilities, and wastewater from any other organization.
• Water withdrawal: The sum of all water drawn into the boundaries of the organization
from all sources for any use over the course of the reporting period.

Requested content Note: Organizations responding to an electric utilities, metals & mining or coal sector request
should refer to additional sector-specific guidance on this question at the end of the
"Requested content” section.
General
• This question is requesting an aggregated figure for your discharge volumes across
your organization. If you do not have aggregated company-wide volumetric data, you
may provide an estimate and give an explanation in column 5 (Please explain).
190

• Zero discharge permit: If your company has a zero discharge permit, please consider
any discharges that may exist outside this permit and may still be relevant to CDP’s
definition of discharges.
• Rainwater: Rainwater/run-off that enters the site/facility boundary and is captured
could also be counted as an output or discharge (even if not used in operations) if
returned to the water environment via a dedicated discharge destination; e.g. river or
groundwater via soakaway/filtration pond. You may choose to exclude collected
rainwater from your discharge accounting, unless this would result in an error in your
balance of more than 5%.
o Note that in the mining industry precipitation/rainwater volumes may
constitute a principal input of water at site level and excluding rainwater
would not be a true reflection of their site water balance. Companies in this
sector (and others to which this is relevant) should report rainwater/runoff
drawn into the boundaries of their operations and then discharged and
explain this in column 5.
• Cooling water: Cooling water (freshwater or sea water) is often withdrawn in large
quantities and discharged back to its original source with negligible losses or variation in
quality. However, this should be included in your water accounts.
• Domestic sources: Domestic sewage is not regarded as water discharge. However, if
wastewater comes from domestic sources but is pre-dominantly generated from sector
business activities e.g. healthcare residential properties, this should be reported if it
would result in an error in your balance of more than 5%.
• Aquifer reinjection: reinjection to aquifers should be considered as a discharge to
groundwater.
• Soakaway: Water returning to a groundwater source via a soakaway should be
considered as a discharge.
• Groundwater (oil & gas sector only): In oil production, as part of secondary and tertiary
recovery operations, water-based fluids (from various sources) may be used to maintain
the pressure, and to displace the hydrocarbons and move them towards the production
wells. For CDP disclosure, organizations must report these volumes as discharges to
groundwater bodies, to enable comparability and have an accurate water balance.
Relevance (column 1)
• Select:
o ‘Relevant’ if your company uses, has used or plans to use the source, even if
the discharge is zero for this reporting year.
o ‘Relevant but volume unknown’ if your company uses, has used or plans to
use the source, but the volume for this year is unknown. Columns 2, 3 and 4
will then be disabled. You should provide further explanation in column 5
(Please explain).
o ‘Not relevant’ if your company does not discharge to the destination.
Columns 2, 3 and 4 will then be disabled. You should provide further
explanation in column 5 (Please explain).
Volume (megaliters/year) (column 2)
• Volumes should be reported in megaliters per year (1 megaliter = 1 million liters or 1000
m3). Your reporting year is the time period you stated in response to question 1.4.
• If you do have volumetric data for the current reporting year you may provide an
estimate and explain why this is the case in column 5.
191

• Note that a zero should only be used for reporting zero volumes and not for an absence
of data.
• If reporting zero discharges, provide an explanation in column 5.
• Before deciding whether your discharges should be reported as “zero”, please refer to
CDP’s definition of water discharges. This may be the case, for example, if a closed
water circuit, or zero liquid effluent discharge complex, is in operation and a facility does
not discharge water as all water is reused by the operation(s) during
processing/production.
Comparison with previous reporting year (column 3)
• CDP does not define the threshold for considering a value as ‘much higher’ rather than
simply ‘higher’ (or ‘much lower’/’lower’). CDP requests this information from many
different industries with huge variations in water use, and it would therefore be difficult
to provide a universal threshold that is meaningful (as proportions will equate to
different absolute values and impacts).
• CDP recommends that you define your own threshold for what is ‘much higher’ (and
‘much lower’) and apply it consistently so that each year the reported data for this
question is comparable and data users can track your water accounts more effectively.
A company-specific explanation for these thresholds should be provided in column 5 for
each destination.
• If the data was not previously reported, but was collected, you may choose to indicate a
comparison with the previous year or select "This is our first year of measurement". In
either case, use the “Please explain” column to provide details about the information
reported.
Primary reason for comparison with previous reporting year (column 4)
• Select the most significant reason for the comparison with previous reporting year.
• ‘Maximum potential volume reduction already achieved’ refers to situations where
water saving limits have been reached – for example where a closed-loop water
recycling system has been put in place and further water reductions are not feasible.
Please explain (column 5)
• To assist CDP data users to understand a company’s water use, you should explain your
selections for ‘Relevance’ (column 1) and ‘Primary reason for comparison with previous
reporting year’ (column 4), including any company-specific contextual information.
• Report whether your volumes for each destination are estimated, modelled, or sourced
from direct measurements. If estimation or modelling has been used, report the
estimation or modelling methods.
• To give data users confidence in your response, please explain any zero volumes for
relevant destinations; e.g. if a completely closed loop cooling system has been
introduced. Remember to report any discharged water that exceeds site storage
capacity, e.g. excessive rainfall, as a separate discharge.
• Describe the thresholds for what is ‘much higher’ and ‘much lower’ for the change in
volumes compared to the previous reporting year.
• Indicate the anticipated future trends for these volumes, if known (note that future
trends would be at least one year after the end of the reporting year provided in 1.4).
• For discharges to a Third-party, it is important to state if this includes water supplied to
other organizations for their use.

Requested content – Sector-specific guidance for electric utilities sector
Sector specific
General
• This guidance is specific to companies responding to an electric utilities sector request.
You should first read the guidance for this question that applies to all companies. This is
additional to the general guidance and does not replace it.
• CDP recognizes the difficulty in accounting for some elements of the hydropower
operations’ water balance, specifically seepage or those that are outside the
organization’s control such as third-party withdrawals.
• In hydropower operations, water discharge includes the dam outlet and the spillway,
underground seepage and third-party withdrawals from the reservoir (for example a
municipal water plant abstracting from the reservoir):
D = Dam outlet + Spillway + Seepage + Third-party withdrawals from the reservoir
• Organizations should strive to include volumes for those destinations if they would
result in an estimated error in their water balance of more than 5% (specifically the total
discharge figure you report in 9.2.2) and take a consistent approach throughout the
questionnaire. In the last column (Please explain), you should explain which destinations
you have included or excluded. Note that estimation or modelling are valid sources of
data.
Relevance (column 1)
• For your hydropower operations - if the data for third-party withdrawals from the
reservoir or the seepage volumes are not available, you may select “Relevant but volume
unknown” or “Not relevant” depending on which best applies to your organization. You
may consider water volumes to be relevant if the resulting error in the organization´s
water balance would be more than 5%.
Please explain (column 5)
• For hydropower operations explain if any changes in the water discharge volumes are
related to higher/lower electricity production or other reasons related to water resources
management such as flood control, satisfaction of downstream water demand, etc.
• Indicate which elements of water discharges (dam outlet and spillway, seepage and

Sector-specific guidance for metals & mining and coal sectors
General
• This guidance is specific to companies responding to a metals & mining or coal sector
request. You should first read the guidance for this question that applies to all
companies. This is additional to the general guidance and does not replace it.
Destination (column 0)
• Brackish water/seawater: Discharges to brackish or seawater refer to the controlled
discharge to estuary or to sea discharge volumes. This aligns with the Water
Accounting Framework from the Mineral Council of Australia.
• Groundwater: Discharges to groundwater refer to seepage or aquifer reinjection
discharge volumes. This aligns with the Water Accounting Framework from the Mineral
Council of Australia.
193

Explanation of terms • Brackish surface water/seawater: Surface water in which the concentration of salts is
high and far exceeds normally acceptable standards for municipal, domestic or
irrigation use (at least higher than 10,000 mg/l TDS). Seawater has a typical
concentration of salts above 35,000 mg/l TDS.
• Fresh surface water, including wetlands, rivers and lakes: Water that is naturally
occurring water on the Earth's surface and has a low concentration of dissolved
solids. For the purposes of reporting water accounting data to CDP, this surface water
source includes water of a quality generally acceptable for, or requiring minimal
treatment to be acceptable for, domestic, municipal or agricultural uses (at least
<10,000 mg/l TDS, though a range of additional quality properties may also be
considered). “High quality” fresh water sources considered acceptable for potable use
are typically characterized as having concentrations of dissolved solids less than 1,000
mg/l.
• Discharges to groundwater: Discharge to groundwater, by human activity or natural
activity, refers to a destination beneath the soil surface, such as a water bearing layer of
rock (aquifer). Examples of discharges to groundwater include disposal of sewage, trade
effluent and surface water run-off from urban areas, through such methods as
spreading basins, soakaways, swales or injection wells.
• Third-party destinations: This includes municipal wastewater plants, public or private
utilities, and other organizations involved in the transport, treatment, disposal or further
use of wastewater.
• Note that to qualify as a third-party destination, “other organizations” using your
wastewater must be outside your reporting boundary given in question 1.5.
• Any of your wastewater that has been treated on your own site should be reported as
discharge according to its ultimate destination (for example, to groundwater), as this is
where any potential risks for the company lie.
Water discharge: The sum of effluents and other water leaving the boundaries of the
organization (or facility) and released to surface water, groundwater, or third parties over
the course of the reporting period (adapted from GRI Standard 306-1, 2016).

Rationale Reporting on levels of treatment demonstrates that the organization is monitoring its
discharges and is able to understand the extent to which its activities impact water quality.
Pollution is a driver of business risk and a potential threat to public health, food security, and
economic resilience – as well as a cause of degradation of freshwater biodiversity. Treatment
of discharge is therefore critical and transparency on this will aid investors, customers, and
other data users to assess the risks and opportunities.

Requested content General
• This question requests a figure for your discharge volumes by treatment level
aggregated across your direct operations. If you do not have company-wide volumetric
data, you may provide an estimate and state this in column 6 (Please explain). You
should account for 100% of the total discharge volume disclosed in 9.2.2.
Highest level of treatment within direct operations (column 0)
• This refers to the level of treatment applied by your organization to water at the point of
discharge. If water has been treated to multiple levels, report the volume in the row for
the highest level of treatment only. For example, if the total discharge reported in 9.2.2 is
10,000 megaliters, and 9,000 megaliters of this are treated to primary, secondary, and
tertiary levels, but the remaining 1,000 megaliters are only treated to primary level, then:
o 9,000 megaliters should be reported in the “Tertiary treatment” row,
o 0 megaliters should be reported in the “Secondary treatment” row, and,
o 1,000 megaliters should be reported in the “Primary treatment only” row.
• Discharge to the natural environment without treatment: This row is for the volume of
water you discharge from your company boundary without treatment, and to a
destination other than a third party.
• Discharge to a third party without treatment: This row is for the volume of water you
discharge from your company boundary to a third party which may then treat it.
• Other treatment: If you treat water using specific treatment techniques, disclose this
volume in this row and provide details in column 6 (Please explain), i.e. a description of
each technique used and the volumes treated; for example, nature-based solutions such
as a constructed wetland, managed by the organization and designed to treat
discharge.
Relevance of treatment level to discharge (column 1)
• Select:
o ‘Relevant’ if this level of treatment is relevant to your business activities and
the nature of your discharge, (even if the volume is reported as zero for this
reporting year because this is not the highest level of treatment).
196

o ‘Relevant but volume unknown’ if your company uses, has used, or plans to
treat discharge to this level, but the volume for this year is unknown and
cannot be estimated. Columns 2, 3, 4 and 5 will not be presented and you
should provide further explanation in column 6 (Please explain).
o ’Not relevant” ONLY if this level of treatment is not relevant to your business
activities and the nature of your discharge. Columns 2, 3, 4, and 5 will not be
presented. Your selection here should not be impacted by your use, or
relevance, of other levels of treatment. should provide further explanation in
column 6 for your selection in column 1.
Volume (megaliters/year) (column 2)
• Volumes should be reported in megaliters per year (1 megaliter = 1 million liters or 1000
m3). Your reporting year is the time period you stated in response to question 1.4.
• If you do not have volumetric data for the current reporting year you may provide an
estimate and explain why this is the case in column 6 (Please explain).
• Note that a zero should only be used for reporting zero volumes and not for absence of
data.
• If reporting zero discharges for a level of treatment, provide an explanation in column 6.
Before deciding whether your discharges should be reported as “zero”, please refer to
CDP’s definition of water discharges.
Comparison of treated volume with previous reporting year (column 3)
• CDP does not define the threshold for considering a value as ‘much higher’ rather than
simply ‘higher’ (or ‘much lower’/’lower’). CDP requests information from many different
industries with huge variations in water use, and it would therefore be difficult to provide
a universal threshold that is meaningful (as proportions will equate to different absolute
values and impacts).
• CDP recommends that you define your own threshold for what is ‘much higher’ (and
‘much lower’) and apply it consistently so that the reported data for this question is
comparable and data users can track your water accounts more effectively each year. A
company-specific explanation for these thresholds should be provided in column 6
(Please explain).
• If the data was not previously reported, but was collected, you may choose to indicate a
comparison with the previous year or select "This is our first year of measurement". In
either case, use the “Please explain” column to provide details about the information
reported.
Primary reason for comparison with previous reporting year (column 4)
• Select the most significant reason for the comparison with previous reporting year.
• ‘Maximum potential volume reduction already achieved’ refers to situations where
water saving limits have been reached – for example where a closed-loop water
recycling system has been put in place and further water reductions are not feasible.
% of your sites/facilities/operations this volume applies to (column 5)
• Select the proportion of your organization’s facilities for which the volume reported in
column 2(Volume) accounts for, or indicate if this is unknown. For example, a company
that has 100 facilities across its total operations and treats the volume of water
provided in column 2 at 45% of its facilities (45 facilities) would select “41-50” in column
5 for that row.
197

Please explain (column 6)
• Explain why this level of treatment has been applied to your discharge. Refer to specific
business activities and associated hazardous waste types, and any regulatory or
voluntary standards that apply.
• Indicate the anticipated future trends for these volumes, if known (note that the future
trends would be at least one year after the end of the reporting year provided in 1.4)
• Describe the thresholds for what is ‘much higher’ and ‘much lower’ for the change in
volumes compared to the previous reporting year.
• To assist CDP data users to understand a company’s water use, you should explain your
selections for ‘Relevance’ (column 1) and ‘Primary reason for comparison with previous
reporting year’ (column 4), including any company-specific contextual information.
• If you indicated that a level of treatment is “Not relevant” or “Relevant but volume
unknown” provide the reason here.
• If you indicated that volumes are discharged to third party destinations, state the
highest level of treatment the third party applies, or state unknown if that is the case.
Explanation of terms • Primary treatment: Primary treatment involves the physical removal of suspended
solids and floating material, typically by sedimentation. A preliminary treatment may
often be applied involving the physical removal of large debris, large particles, oils, and
grease, typically through screens and grit chambers.
• Secondary treatment: Secondary treatment involves the degradation of organic matter
and reduction of solids through biological treatment. The removal of nutrients (nitrogen
and/or phosphorus) can also be achieved at this level of treatment using a combination
of chemical and biological treatments. Secondary treatment follows primary treatment.
• Tertiary treatment: Tertiary treatment involves the additional treatment needed to
remove suspended, colloidal and dissolved constituents (nutrients, heavy metals,
inorganic and other contaminants) remaining after secondary treatment through a
number of processes including granular media filtration, biological nitrification-
denitrification, biological phosphorus removal, chlorination, etc.. Tertiary treatment
follows secondary treatment.

direct operations this volume applies to
Tertiary treatment 100% Relevant: At all our plants, we treat discharge to remove nitrogen and
phosphorus, along with other dissolved inorganic substances through
coagulation, sedimentation, activated carbon absorption and ion
exchange methods. Tertiary treatment was applied to 100% of our total
discharges this reporting year. All discharge volumes were subject to
strict water quality controls before being released to receiving water
bodies.
Change in volume: 29,980 megalitres were treated to tertiary level in the
previous year and 29,500 megalitres were treated to tertiary level this
year. Therefore, the volume has decreased by 480 megalitres (equivalent
to a decrease of 1.6%). This decrease is due to reduced quantities of
domestic water use in some of our plants after implementing efficiency
measures. Our definition of change: Much higher: >+10%, Higher: >+5%,
About the same: <+/-5%, Lower: >-5%, Much lower: >-10%.
Anticipated future trend: Discharge volumes treated to tertiary level are
expected to remain the same in the upcoming years as no significant
alterations are being planned for the production processes.
Secondary 100% Relevant: All discharge volumes were treated to secondary level this year.
treatment Discharge containing organic compounds is generated at our facilities
that clean and process natural rubber. We monitor water discharge
quality (e.g., pH, BOD, COD, SS, harmful substances, etc.) based on
applicable regulations by continuous real time monitoring or third-party
sampling analysis at all of our facilities (mostly on a monthly basis). Our
facilities have implemented water effluent standards that meet or tighten
applicable government standards.
Change in volume: There has been a 69 megaliter increase in this volume
from the previous year (equivalent to an increase of 0.62%). The
discharge volume treated to secondary level last reporting year was
11,082 megaliters, and for the current reporting year it was 11,151
megaliters. This was due to a slight increase in production, resulting in
higher water withdrawals.
Our definition for change: Much higher: >+10%, Higher: >+5%, About the
same: <+/-5%, Lower: >-5%, Much lower: >-10%.
Anticipated future trend: it is expected that the volume of discharge (and
the volume treated to a secondary treatment level) will increase slightly in
the next few years due to increases in production, relating to COVID-19
recovery.
199

Primary treatment 11-20 Relevant: 15% of the company's discharge is pre-treated to primary level
only before discharge to local treatment facilities under municipal discharge
permits. Primary treatment of manufacturing and R&D discharge varies
depending on the characteristics of the sub-operation's discharge, and
may include pH adjustment, flocculation, sedimentation and filtration.
Change in volume: This treatment accounted for 15% of total discharges
this year, a decrease of 2% from last year given one of our plants idled
and later sold.
Our definition of change: About the same: <4%, Lower/Higher: <8%, Much
lower/higher: >8%. This threshold is also used for the future trend.
Anticipated future trend: Given that our company has a target to reduce
process water use / tonne by 30% between 2020 and 2030, it is expected
that the discharge volumes requiring treatment will sightly decrease due
to more efficient water use.
Discharge to the Question not applicable Not relevant: In all our plants, discharge is not released to the natural
natural environment without treatment. Water volumes are discharged either
environment without after on-site treatment/purification or after treatment by a third party.
treatment
Discharge to a third 71-80 Relevant: In our sites, water is primarily used for cooling molds. In
party without addition, water is used for drinking water and sanitation/hygiene
treatment services. These volumes are discharged to a third party without
treatment.
Change in volume: The discharge volume (25,277 megaliters) in the
reporting year is slightly lower than the previous year (26,350 megaliters)
due to the COVID-19 crisis which resulted in lower production.
Our definition for change: Much higher: >+10%, Higher: >+5%, About the
same: <+/-5%, Lower: >-5%, Much lower: >-10%.
Anticipated future trend: The discharge volume is expected to increase
due to post COVID-19 market expectations (growth).
Treatment applied by third party: The third party (municipal sewage
treatment plant) applies a conventional secondary treatment, and the
treatment plant publicly states compliance with local water regulations.
Other Less than 1% Relevant: Some of our sites treat high-quality surface runoff volumes
(predominantly stormwater) utilizing natural filtration zones such as
wetlands, rather than processing through a wastewater treatment plant.
Monitoring of these discharges for potential pollutants occurs.
Change in volume: The discharge volume (5,286 megaliters) in the
reporting year increased by about 3% from the previous year (5,120
megaliters) due to a slight increase in total precipitation over the
reporting year.
Our definition for change: About the same is within +/- <5%, Lower or
Higher +/- 5% to 9%, and Much lower or Much higher +/- >10%.
200

Anticipated future trend: This volume depends largely on precipitation
and other weather patterns. The volume may be larger or smaller
depending on the amount of precipitation received and the resulting
stormwater runoff.

• CDP requests nitrates and phosphates as opposed to nitrogen and phosphorus in
compliance with SFDR indicators and common practice across global water quality
indices. If your organization measures phosphorus instead of phosphates, you are
expected to re-calculate the total figure based on the substances requested in this
question. You may use the "Please explain" column to provide contextual
information.
Emissions to water in the reporting year (metric tons) (column 1)
• Enter a figure for total emissions to water in the reporting year.
• Emissions to water should be reported in metric tons (1 metric ton = 1,000
kilograms). Your reporting year is the time period you stated in response to 1.4.
• Entering a zero implies that measurements have been taken, and the value is zero.
Do not enter a zero if no data is available.
Categories of substances included (column 2)
• Select all the substances that are included in your calculation of the figure in column
1.
• For ‘Priority substances listed under the EU Water Framework Directive’, refer to this
list. See ‘Explanation of terms’ for more information.
• If your emissions to water include pesticides which are also part of the EU Water
Framework Directive's list of Priority Substances, select both 'Pesticides' and 'Priority
substances listed under the EU Water Framework Directive'.
List the specific substances included (column 3)
• This column is only presented if ‘Priority substances listed under the EU Water

Please explain (column 4)
• Briefly explain which parts of your business are emitting these pollutants and why.
• Indicate whether the emissions to water are nearby to any vulnerable communities or
within water stressed areas and if there is a plan to reduce or manage these
pollutants (details on pollutant management plans can be provided in 2.5.1).
• You may use this field to provide any other contextual information, for example, the
geographical areas implicated.
Explanation of terms • Emissions to water: This metric tracks the mass of any solid, liquid or gaseous
pollutants or contaminants, such as nitrates and pesticides, released to bodies of water
by your organization in the reporting year.
• List of priority substances under the EU Water Framework Directive: means the list of
priority substances in the field of water policy in Annex X of the Directive 2013/39/EU of
the European Parliament and of the Council of August 2013. The review of the priority
substances list has been supported by an extensive consultation with experts from the
Commission services, Member States, stakeholders and the Scientific Committee on
Health and Environmental Risks. Other relevant Community legislation or relevant
international agreements were also considered.
Additional information In water, nitrogen and phosphorus commonly exist in the form of nitrates and phosphates.
Nitrates, the most water-soluble form of nitrogen, and phosphates, a chemical compound
containing phosphorus, are commonly detected pollutants in ground and surface water
sources. Both are significant contributors to eutrophication and can lead to harmful algae

Facility-level water accounting & Verification
Section This section asks organizations to identify the number of facilities with substantive water-related
Overview dependencies, impacts, risks, and/or opportunities, and report the water accounting data from

Data users are interested in an organization’s ability to measure, monitor, and disclose this
granular accounting data as a proxy for sound assessment and management at the facility and
organization level. Limiting this disclosure to facilities with substantive water-related
dependencies, impacts, risks, and/or opportunities helps a company to focus its understanding of
how it uses and impacts water resources at ‘hotspot’ locations. Given the local nature of water
issues, reporting at this level is considered as good practice.

(9.3) In your direct operations and upstream value chain, what is the number of facilities where you have
identified substantive water-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities?
Question details
Change from last year No change
Rationale Water is a local issue, and data users want to know that organizations are considering
dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities at the facility level. Reporting the total
count of facilities where substantive water-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and/or
opportunities have been identified provides a basic but useful indication of the
organization’s reliance on these areas. Reporting the proportion of total facilities in your
direct operations that have been identified allows data users to understand the importance
of these facilities relative to the size of your organization.

Requested content
General
• This question only requests information about facilities with substantive water-related
dependencies, impacts, risks and/or opportunities. Do not count local dependencies,
impacts, risks and/or opportunities unless they are substantive for the organization as
a whole.
• Note that you are requested to disclose inherent dependencies, impacts, risks and/or
opportunities – so include those that your organization is exposed to prior to the
implementation of any response strategies.
• Facilities where opportunities have been identified should only be included where the
facility has also been identified to have water-related dependencies, impacts and/or
risks.
• Facilities disclosed in this question may be situated within or near the priority
locations reported in 2.3.
Identification of facilities in the value chain stage (column 1)
• The options in this column are driven by your selections in 2.2. Options “Yes, we have
assessed this value chain stage and identified facilities with substantive water-related
dependencies, impacts, risks, and/or opportunities” and “No, we have assessed this
value chain stage but did not identify facilities with substantive water-related
dependencies, impacts, risks, and/or opportunities” will only appear if “Yes” is selected
in column 1 of 2.2.
Total number of facilities identified (column 2)
204

• The definition of facility may vary between organizations or sectors. See the
Explanation of terms for more information.
• You may aggregate facilities. For example, a hotel chain may wish to group hotels by
grade or resort type. Rather than assess each of its 20 hotels individually it may be
more appropriate to combine 20 hotels within the same river basin into one “facility”.
The organization can then assess this against its threshold for substantive effect on
the organization as described in 2.4.
• Note the following on the aggregation of facilities:
o Due to the local nature of water dependencies, impacts, risks, and
opportunities, only facilities in the same river basin and the same jurisdiction
may be aggregated. In the case of very large river basins, facilities in a single
basin may face different regulatory as well as local physical risks so that
aggregation would obscure an understanding of the organization's water
dependency and risk exposure in the region.
o - Organizations should consider aggregating facilities within a river basin if the
dependencies, impacts, risks and/or opportunities of a single local facility are
not substantive but would be substantive in aggregate with other similar local
facilities. For example, a single factory with low water use may not have a
substantive dependency on a river. However, when aggregated together with
other local facilities, the cumulative effect on the river basin could be
substantial.
o Aggregation of facilities should not be used where information on the risk
exposure, or water accounting data, of the single facility would be meaningful
and specific to that facility.
• There is a limit of 1,000 on the total number of facilities that you may report as having
dependencies, impacts, risks and or/opportunities. This is because you should only count
facilities, or groups of facilities, that expose your organization to substantive
dependencies, impacts, risks and/or opportunities according to your definition in 2.4. If
you have more than 1,000 it may be that your definition of substantive effects on your
organization in 2.4 is extreme. If you have identified more than 1,000 facilities, consider
aggregating some facilities in line with the above note and use the “Please explain”
column to describe the aggregation.
% of facilities this represents (column 3)
• This column is only presented if “Yes, we have assessed this value chain stage and
identified facilities with water-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities”
is selected in the “Direct operations” row.
• Within your direct operations, detail the proportion of your organization’s facilities with
substantive water-related dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities, as
represented by the number given in column 2 “Total number of facilities identified”. For
example, the 11 facilities that are exposed to substantive water risk reported in column
2 “Total number of facilities identified” may comprise 26-50% of your organization’s
total facilities company-wide. You may estimate this data and use column 4 “Please
explain” to state that this is the case.
• If you cannot provide this figure, select “Unknown” and explain your response in
column 4 “Please explain”.
Please explain (column 4)
• You may comment on how you have defined “facility”. If your organization does
aggregate for reporting purposes, please state that this approach has been taken and
briefly describe the methodology for aggregation.
205

• To help data users understand the number of facilities you have reported, please
provide any further context. For example, you may wish to give a general, organization-
specific comment on the nature, severity and location of the corporate-level
dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities that your organization is exposed to,
whether they result from any particular business activity, and the relationship between
the inherent risk and your residual risk exposure. You may have reported that 60% of
your facilities are exposed to inherent risks due to their location, but this represents
only 30% of your total output and the residual risk has been much reduced due to the
introduction of new controls. It is helpful to data-users if you give organization-specific
information.
• Note that river basin level information about facilities at risk should be disclosed in
3.2.
• If you have not carried out an assessment, briefly explain why.
Explanation of terms • Facilities: may be used throughout this questionnaire as a broad term and not
restricted to a particular site or grouping of fixed buildings and factories. For example,
if your organization is in the extractive industries you might normally collate business
information for assets or business units, and so you may wish to define ‘facility’
information in this way.

Question text
Question This question only appears if you have selected “Yes, we have assessed this value chain
dependencies stage and identified facilities with substantive water-related dependencies, impacts, risks,
and/or opportunities” in column “Identification of facilities in this value chain stage” in one or
both rows of 9.3.

Rationale Reporting information on facilities where you have identified substantive water-related
dependencies, impacts, risks, and/or opportunities helps data users have confidence that
your organization is monitoring local water aspects. It provides insight to dependency on
different sources and potential impacts associated with water withdrawals and discharges.
For example, withdrawing from an overdrawn freshwater aquifer rather than from seawater
will have significantly different consequences for local areas with water stress and an
organization's water security. In regions where water sources are highly restricted, the
organization's water consumption patterns can influence relations with other stakeholders.
Providing facility-level information is useful for demonstrating regulatory compliance (e.g.,
discharges to the local environment), for risk assessments and for providing insight to risk
responses (e.g., tracking water efficiency improvements).
Geo-location coordinates for your facilities with substantive water-related dependencies,
impacts, risks, and/or opportunities enables data users to analyze geographically linked
dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities and to do so across multiple companies.
This also facilitates the integration of CDP’s water data with other geographically linked data.

Requested content Note: Organizations responding to an electric utilities, metals & mining, coal, or oil & gas
sector request should refer to additional sector-specific guidance on this question at the end
of the "Requested content” section.
General
• This question asks for water accounting data only for facilities with substantive
water-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and/or opportunities – not for all
facilities.
• Refer to CDP's water accounting definitions before completing this question.
• Enter data for each facility (or groups of facilities) you identified in 9.3 with
substantive water-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and/or opportunities. The
table has a maximum of 100 rows. If your organization has over 100 facilities with
substantive water-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and/or opportunities, report
the 100 facilities with the highest levels of dependencies, impacts, risks, or
opportunities. This may be based on facilities located in areas with water stress,
facilities with the highest risk exposure, or other factors.
• The data reported in this question should be based on the relevant facility boundary
(see Explanations of terms).
• The appearance of columns in this question is driven by your selection in column 3
“Value chain stage” and column 5 “Withdrawals or discharges in the reporting year”.
• Only report Tier 1 supplier facilities if relevant to your selection in column 3 “Value
chain stage”.
• Report volumetric data in megaliters per year for the reporting year you stated in
response to 1.4. (1 megaliter = 1 million liters or 1000 m3).
• If estimating or extrapolating to provide complete coverage, give an explanation in
column 29 “Please explain”. Remember that a zero should only be used for reporting
zero volumes and not for an absence of data.
• If you do not have a figure for any of the facilities you disclose here, you may
provide an estimate. Explain this in column “Please explain”. For withdrawals, data
may be collected from several sources, including water meters, water bills,
calculations derived from other available water data or the organization’s own
estimates if neither water meters nor bills or reference data exist.
• Cooling water: Cooling water (freshwater or sea water) is often withdrawn in large
quantities and discharged back to its original source with negligible losses or
variation in quality. However, this volume should be included in your water
accounts.
• Rainwater: If a company is managing rainwater (for example, by harvesting for use
or storage, or to prevent flooding), or is dependent on it for production of goods or
the delivery of services, it should try to estimate and disclose it as a withdrawal
from the hydrological system into the company boundary. Note that in some
jurisdictions rainwater is considered a withdrawal source and organizations are
required to report its collection and use.
o Companies may choose to exclude collected rainwater and domestic
sewage from their water withdrawal/discharge volumes only if the resulting
error in their water balance would be less than 5%. This avoids your
discharge volumes being larger than your withdrawals.
o Including rainwater helps companies better understand their water
dependency and risks. For some companies, precipitation/rainwater
volumes may constitute a principal input of water at site level. This includes
run-off where it must be managed. In these cases, excluding rainwater from
211

water accounting – withdrawal and discharge - would not be a true
reflection of site water balance. In addition, there may be reduced impacts
from using rainwater in place of other local freshwater sources.
Facility reference number (column 1)
• This CDP facility reference number is used to track information related to the same
facility in subsequent questions. It is not specific to your organization, however it does
prevent you from having to repeat contextual information e.g., river basin and facility
name.
Facility name (column 2)
• You may use the text box to provide a name for the facility to ease reporting and
analysis. The same facility name should be used throughout the questionnaire
Value chain stage (column 3)
• Indicate in which stages of your value chain the facility or facilities with substantive
water-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and/or opportunities are located.
• If “Direct operations” is selected, all following columns will be presented.
• If “Upstream value chain” is selected, columns 15-20 and 23-26 will not be
presented.
• Note: the presentation of the columns specified above will also depend on your
selection in column 5 “Withdrawals or discharges in the reporting year”.
Withdrawals or discharges in the reporting year (column 5)
• Select any “Yes” option if the facility has withdrawals and/or discharges.
• Select “No” if there are no withdrawals and discharges by this facility.
• If either “No” or “Yes, withdrawals only” is selected, columns 21-26 will not be
presented.
• If either “No” or “Yes, discharges only” is selected, columns 13-20 will not be
presented.
• Note: the presentation of the columns specified above will also depend on your
selection in column 3 “Value chain stage”.
• If the facility has withdrawals or discharges, but you do not have figures for this
data, you may provide an estimate and explain in the last column “Please explain”.
Reason for no withdrawals and/or discharges (column 6)
• This column will only be presented if “Yes, withdrawals only”, “Yes, discharges only”
or “No” is selected in column 5 “Withdrawals or discharges in the reporting year”.
• Explain why the facility has substantive water-related dependencies, impacts, risks,
and/or opportunities with no withdrawals and/or discharges.
• If your organization has both zero withdrawals and discharges, clearly indicate the
reason for each.
Country/Area & River basin (column 7)
• From the drop-down options provided, select the river basin where the facility is
located. If you do not see the basin required, select “Other, please specify” and write
in one river basin only using the text box provided.
• For organizations withdrawing water from large confined aquifers that may not
discharge to the river basin they are located in e.g., Ogallala aquifer in the United
212

States, please select “Other, please specify” and type in the name of the local aquifer
source.
• You may want to put the sub-basin of a bigger river basin identified in the drop-
down menu. In this case use the “Other, please specify” option in the following
format: “Putumayo, Amazon”.
• If you select “Other, please specify”, provide a label for the river basin.
• For full instructions see the overview of CDP’s full corporate questionnaire, available
in the guidance tool.
Latitude (column 8)
• This column is only presented if “Direct operations” is selected in column 3 “Value
chain stage”.
• Enter the latitude coordinates for the facility reported in column 1. Your response
should be in the format of decimal degrees and can range from 0 to +/-90.000000.
• If you are disclosing for a cluster of facilities in accordance with the guidance for
9.3, you may provide the coordinates for the facility with the largest total withdrawal
volumes.
Longitude (column 9)
• This column is only presented if “Direct operations” is selected in column 3 “Value
chain stage”.
• Enter the longitude coordinates for the facility reported in this row. Your response
should be in the format of decimal degrees and can range from 0 to +/-180.000000.
• If you are disclosing for a cluster of facilities in accordance with the guidance for
9.3, you may provide the coordinates for the facility with the largest total withdrawal
volumes.
Located in area with water stress (column 10)
• Credible, publicly available methodologies for classifying an area as water stressed
include the WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas and WWF Water Risk Filter. Refer to the
guidance for 9.2.4 for more details.
• As good practice, a water-stressed area should be measured at the catchment level
as a minimum.
• Commonly accepted global indicators to assess areas as water stressed and their
thresholds for reporting to CDP include:
o Water availability – category greater than ‘High risk’: 3.4 (WWF Water Risk
Filter). WWF recommends that users also take into consideration ‘Medium
risk’: >2.6.
§ The WWF Water Risk Filter’s risk category ‘Water Availability’
integrates the State of Nature layer for Water Availability
recommended for the Science-based Targets for Nature (SBTN)
Step 1: Assess and Step 2: Interpret & Prioritize. The SBTN’s State of
Nature layer for Water Availability is calculated based on a multi-
model approach which integrates the best available global water
scarcity risk indicators: Water depletion, Baseline water stress, and
Blue water scarcity. In addition, WWF has incorporated an indicator
on groundwater availability in the WWF Water Risk Filter’s risk
category ‘Water Availability’.
§ WWF recommends using the ‘Drought’ risk category as
supplementary information to help in interpreting results and
prioritizing sites in water stressed areas, as droughts can
exacerbate water stress/water availability.
213

o Baseline water stress – indicator equal to/greater than ‘High’: 40-80%
(WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas). This refers to the ratio of total annual
water withdrawals to available renewable water supply.
o Baseline water depletion – indicator equal to/greater than ‘High’: 50-75%
(WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas). This refers to the ratio of total annual
water consumption to available renewable water supply.
Comparison with previous reporting year (columns 14, 22, 28)
• CDP does not define the threshold for considering a value as “much higher” rather
than simply “higher” or “much lower”/“lower”. CDP requests this information from
many different industries with huge variations in water use, and it would therefore
be difficult to provide a universal threshold that is meaningful as proportions will
equate to different absolute values and impacts.
• You should define your own threshold for what is “much higher” and “much lower”
and apply it consistently so that each year the reported data for this question is
comparable and data users can track your water accounts more effectively. A
company-specific explanation for these thresholds should be provided in column
"Please explain".
• If your response is an estimate, please explain why in column “Please explain”.
• If the data was not previously reported, but was collected, you may choose to
indicate a comparison with the previous reporting year or select "This is our first
year of measurement". In either case, use the “Please explain” column to provide
details about the information reported.
Withdrawals from fresh surface water, including rainwater, water from wetlands, rivers, and lakes
(column 15)
• This column is only presented if “Direct operations” is selected in column 3 and “Yes,
withdrawals and discharges” or “Yes, withdrawals only” are selected in column 5
“Withdrawals or discharges in the reporting year”.
• For the purposes of this disclosure you should include all surface water sources of
a higher quality than brackish i.e., a TDS lower than 10,000 mg/l.
Total water discharges at this facility (megaliters) (column 21)
• This column is only presented if “Yes, withdrawals and discharges” or “Yes,
discharges only” are selected in column 5 “Withdrawals or discharges in the
reporting year”.
• Zero discharge permit: If your organization has a zero discharge permit, please
consider any discharges that may exist outside this permit and may still be relevant
to CDP’s definition of discharges.
• Domestic sewage: Domestic sewage is only regarded as water discharge if
excluding it would result in an error in your balance of more than 5%. This may be
significant for healthcare residential properties or hotels, for example.
• Aquifer reinjection: Reinjection to aquifers should be considered as a discharge to
groundwater.
• Soakaway: Water returning to a groundwater source via a soakaway should be
considered as a discharge.
Please explain (column 29)
• If the facility is an aggregate of multiple locations, explain how your methodology
for aggregating facilities was applied here.
• To assist CDP data users to understand a facility’s water use:
214

o Explain the volumetric data and trends that you report for withdrawals,
discharges and consumption and include organization-specific information.
o Explain the dependencies, impacts, risks, and/or opportunities identified at
the facility and actions and initiatives to address these (e.g., collective
action, Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) certification).
• Indicate the thresholds for what is “much higher” and “much lower” for the change
in volume for each water aspect compared to the previous year. You should
account for the change compared to last year and indicate the anticipated future
trends for these volumes if known. Note that future trends should be at least one
year after the end of the reporting year provided in 1.4.
• Report whether your volumes for each facility are estimated, modelled, or sourced
from direct measurements.
o If estimation or modelling has been used, report the estimation or modelling
methods.
o If there is any level of uncertainty in your response, or if there is an
estimated figure, you should explain it in this field and give the range of
uncertainty.
o Include any contextual information necessary to understand how the
volumetric data have been compiled, such as any standard methodologies
used and any assumptions made.
o If you have left any column blank because you do not have the data,
describe the barriers to reporting that data and any plans to collect and
report it.
• For “Withdrawals from fresh surface water”, it is important that you state which
sources apply, e.g. rainwater, water from wetlands, rivers and lakes, etc.. Also state
if the withdrawal volume for each source is increasing or decreasing. Note: if your
use of rainwater equates to more than 5% of your water balance explain if it is
harvested, treated, etc.
• For “Third party sources”, specify whether the third party is a municipal supplier or
another type of third party organization.
• For discharges to “Third party destinations”, state if this includes water to other
organizations for further use.
• Note: CDP expects withdrawals, discharges and consumption figures to balance
(approximately; +/- 5%), so if there is a good reason why this cannot happen,
explain here.
Please explain – additional guidance for consumption volume
• Regarding your water consumption figure, indicate if your figure is based on local
measurements or is a calculation (for example using withdrawals minus
discharges).
• If known, you may provide breakdown of this figure (with reference to CDP’s
definition of consumption) including:
o Volume incorporated into products, crops or waste;
o Volume evaporated or transpired;
o Volume consumed by humans or livestock;
o Net volume stored in a controlled manner;
o Net volume stored for future use;
o Volumes otherwise excluded from discharges out of the organization’s
boundary.
• It is important to explain a negative consumption figure where this is the case. This
would indicate that your discharges are larger than your withdrawals for the
reporting year e.g., due to a net release of water from storage.
215

Requested content – Sector-specific guidance for electric utilities sector
[sector]
(if applicable) General
• This guidance is specific to companies responding to an electric utilities sector
request. You should first read the guidance for this question that applies to all
companies. This is additional to the general guidance and does not replace it.
Primary power generation source for your electricity generation at this facility (column 11)
• Choose “Not applicable” if this facility is not an electricity generation facility.
Total water withdrawals at this facility (megaliters/year) (column 13)
• CDP recognizes the difficulty in accounting for some elements of the hydropower
operations’ water balance, specifically surface runoff or elements that are outside
the organization’s control such as third-party discharges into the reservoir (for
example a municipal waste water treatment plant discharging into the reservoir).
Water withdrawals into hydropower operations includes river inflow, surface runoff
and precipitation onto the reservoir surface, as well as third-party discharges into
the reservoir:
W = Precipitation + River Inflow + Runoff + Third-party discharges into reservoir
Organizations should strive to include volumes for those sources if they would result in an
estimated error in their water balance of more than 5% (specifically the sum of the
withdrawals you report) and take a consistent approach throughout the questionnaire. In the
last column (Please explain) you should indicate which sources you have included or
excluded. Note that estimation or modelling are valid sources of data.
Total water discharges at this facility (megaliters/year) (column 21)
• CDP recognizes the difficulty in accounting for some elements of the hydropower
operations’ water balance, specifically seepage or those that are outside the
organization’s control such as third-party withdrawals.
In hydropower operations, water discharge includes the dam outlet and the spillway,
underground seepage and third-party withdrawals from the reservoir (for example a
municipal water plant abstracting from the reservoir).
D = Dam outlet + Spillway + Seepage + Third-party withdrawals from the reservoir
Organizations should strive to include volumes for those destinations if they would
result in an estimated error in their water balance of more than 5% (specifically the
sum of the discharges) and take a consistent approach throughout the
questionnaire. In the last column ("Please explain") you should indicate which
destinations you have included or excluded. Note that estimation or modelling are
valid sources of data.
Total water consumption at this facility (megaliters/year) (column 27)
• Water consumption in hydropower operations includes evaporation from the
reservoir surface as well as the balance between withdrawals and discharges.
Although organizations should estimate evaporated volumes, you may consider
variations in storage as a valid measure of your consumption volumes rather than
calculating evaporation and the balance between all withdrawals and discharges.
This information is usually easily derived from water level measurements.
216

• In the last column ("Please explain") provide your approach to reporting a total
consumption figure.
Please explain (column 29)
• If any of the facilities reported are hydropower operations, indicate which elements
of water withdrawals (river inflow, surface runoff, precipitation onto the reservoir
surface and third-party discharges into the reservoir), discharges (spillway,
underground seepage and third-party withdrawals from the reservoir) and
consumption are you taking into account when providing your response.
• Indicate the method followed to obtain it, e.g. direct monitoring, estimation from a
hydrological model or other secondary source of information.
• Explain if any changes in the water discharge volumes are related to higher/lower
electricity production or other reasons related to water resources management
such as flood control, satisfaction of downstream demand, etc.
• Additionally, you may choose to specify the total evaporated volumes from the
reservoir if your organization collects this data.
Sector-specific guidance for metals & mining and coal sectors
General
• This guidance is specific to organizations responding to a metals & mining or coal
sector request. You should first read the guidance for this question that applies to
all organizations. This is additional to the general guidance and does not replace it.
• Data on the production value associated with these facilities will provide further
information on the potential implications of the water risk exposure and assist with
the assessment of the organization’s response.
• Rainwater: Please note that in the mining industry precipitation/rainwater volumes
may constitute a principal input of water at site level. Excluding rainwater from
water accounting would not be a true reflection of site water balance.
• Brackish water/seawater withdrawals or discharges: Low quality water
withdrawals or discharges (categories 2 and 3 of the Water Accounting Framework
from the Mineral Council of Australia) should be reported in columns 16 and 24
(Brackish water) respectively.
• Groundwater withdrawals: Groundwater withdrawals are linked to extraction from
bore holes and aquifer interception, i.e. groundwater is water that is extracted as
part of ore body dewatering during mining operations.
• Produced/entrained water withdrawals: In the mining industry, entrained water
refers to the volumes of water in the raw material, typically ore to be processed.
• Groundwater discharges: Discharges to groundwater refer to seepage or aquifer
reinjection discharge volumes. This aligns with the Water Accounting Framework
from the Mineral Council of Australia
• Water diversions: In line with CDP’s definition of water withdrawals and discharges,
for the mining industry, water withdrawals and discharges include water diversions
to enable comparability – because it is water that crosses the company boundary.
• Evaporation: In line with CDP’s definition of water consumption, evaporation from
open water surfaces should be reported as part of the water consumption volumes.
• Water entrained in waste material: In line with CDP’s definition of water
consumption, water entrained in waste material (such as tailings, coarse rejects,
and concentrates) that leaves the company boundary should not be considered
discharges but as part of the consumption volumes.
Sector-specific guidance for oil & gas sector
217

General
• This guidance is specific to companies responding to an oil & gas sector request.
You should first read the guidance for this question that applies to all companies.
This is additional to the general guidance and does not replace it.
• As water withdrawals, consumption, and discharges will vary according to business
division, a business division column has been added to provide data users on the
type of facility being reported on. This provides useful context for the volumes
reported.
• Groundwater withdrawals: As part of groundwater withdrawal volumes (be it from
renewable or non-renewable sources), organizations should include all withdrawals
from aquifers (other than the formation being exploited). These withdrawals may be
intended for any use in the organization, including its reinjection to maintain well
pressure or as part of the fracture fluids.
• Produced water: In the oil & gas sector, the reporting of water withdrawals volumes
typically does not include produced water. To enable comparability, CDP requires all
companies to include produced water volumes in their withdrawals disclosure, in
order to have an accurate water balance.
• Groundwater discharges: In oil production, as part of secondary and tertiary
recovery operations, water-based fluids (from various sources) may be used to
maintain the pressure, and to displace the hydrocarbons and move them towards
the production wells. For CDP disclosure, organizations must report these volumes
as discharges to groundwater bodies, to enable comparability and have an accurate
water balance.
Oil & gas sector business division (column 12)
• Select the option “Not applicable” for any facilities not belonging to the oil & gas
sector.
• If you select "Other, please specify”, please provide a label for the business division
in the text field provided.
Explanation of terms • Brackish surface water/seawater: Surface water in which the concentration of salts
is high and far exceeds normally acceptable standards for municipal, domestic or
irrigation use (at least higher than 10,000 mg/l TDS). Seawater has a typical
concentration of salts above 35,000 mg/l TDS.
• Carbon capture and storage (CCS) (Electric utilities sector only): As defined by the
IEA, a family of technologies and techniques that enable the capture of carbon dioxide
(CO2) from fuel combustion or industrial processes, the transport of CO2 via ships or
pipelines, and its storage underground, in depleted oil and gas fields and deep saline
formations.
• Discharges to groundwater: Discharge to groundwater, by human activity or natural
activity, refers to a destination beneath the soil surface, such as a water bearing layer
of rock (aquifer). Examples of discharges to groundwater include disposal of sewage,
trade effluent and surface water run-off from urban areas, through such methods as
spreading basins, soakaways, swales or injection wells.
• Facility boundary: This is a management boundary, rather than a physical boundary
or a legal entity. Water is considered to have crossed the boundary of your facility
when your organization in any way uses it, comes into contact with it, is required to
manage it or when it becomes incorporated into your products. It therefore includes
any water use and management by your organization outside of the physical fence of
218

a facility; for example, to provide a street cleaning service or when used in fields that
are remote from a processing plant.
• Facility reference number: Used to track information related to a facility that is
disclosed in different questions. The number is not specific to an organization, but
simply avoids an organization having to repeat contextual information such as river
basin and facility name.
• Fresh surface water, including rainwater, water from wetlands, rivers and lakes:
Water that is naturally occurring water on the Earth's surface in ice sheets, ice caps,
glaciers, icebergs, bogs, ponds, lakes, rivers and streams, and has a low concentration
of dissolved solids.
For the purposes of reporting water accounting data to CDP, this surface water source
includes water of a quality generally acceptable for, or requiring minimal treatment to
be acceptable for, domestic, municipal or agricultural uses (at least <10,000 mg/l TDS,
though a range of additional quality properties may also be considered). ‘High quality’
fresh water sources considered acceptable for potable use are typically characterized
as having concentrations of dissolved solids less than 1,000 mg/l.
• Groundwater (non-renewable): Water which is being held in, and can be recovered
from, an underground formation. Non-renewable groundwater has a negligible rate of
natural recharge on the human time-scale (more than 50 years), and is generally
located at deeper depths than renewable groundwater. This is sometimes referred to
as “fossil” water.
• Groundwater (renewable): Water which is being held in, and can be recovered from,
an underground formation. Renewable groundwater sources can be replenished within
50 years and are usually located at shallow depths.
• Latitude and longitude: geographic coordinates that specify, respectively, the north-
south and east-west position, of a point on the Earth's surface. These coordinates are
expressed as angular measures and thus, latitude can vary from 0 to +/-90 and
longitude from 0 to +/-180.
• Produced water (Oil & gas sector only): water that is brought to the surface during
the production of hydrocarbons including formation water, flow-back water and
condensation water (IPIECA “Oil and gas industry guidance on voluntary sustainability
reporting”, 4th edition, 2020).
• Produced water: Water which enters the organization’s boundary as a result of the
extraction, processing, or use of any raw material, so that it must be managed by the
organization.
When reporting to CDP, this water should not be counted as recycled water when put
to use within a single cycle of a business process. Examples of produced water
include moisture derived from vegetation such as in sugar cane crushing and the
water content in crude oil. (Note that companies with oil and gas activities should refer
to CDP’s sector specific guidance for this water aspect).
• Third party destinations: This includes municipal wastewater plants, public or private
utilities, and other organizations involved in the transport, treatment, disposal or
further use of wastewater. Note that to qualify as a third-party destination, “other
organizations” using your wastewater must be outside your reporting boundary given
in question 1.5. Any of your wastewater that has been treated on your own site should
219

be reported as discharge according to its ultimate destination (for example, to
groundwater), as this is where any potential risks for the company lie.
• Third party sources: This includes water provided by municipal water suppliers, public
or private utilities, and wastewater from any other organization.
• Water consumption: The amount of water drawn into the boundaries of the
organization (or facility) and not discharged back to the water environment or a third
party over the course of the reporting period.
• Water discharge: The sum of effluents and other water leaving the boundaries of the
organization (or facility) and released to surface water, groundwater, or third parties
over the course of the reporting period.
• Water diversions (Metals & mining and coal sectors only): According to the Water
Accounting Framework from the Mineral Council of Australia water diversions are
flows from an input to an output without being utilized by the operational facility. The
flow is not stored with the intention of being used in a task or treated.
• Water withdrawal: The sum of all water drawn into the boundaries of the organization
(or facility) from all sources for any use over the course of the reporting period.
(9.3.2) For the facilities in your direct operations referenced in 9.3.1, what proportion of water accounting

Requested content General
• CDP recognizes the lack of universally applied verification standards for water
accounting and therefore requests that you disclose the extent of any current
verification practices and the standards used.
• Note, in this question we are not asking about verification of water accounting data
across your entire organization but only for the facilities within your direct
operations.
% verified (column 1)
• For the facilities within your direct operations reported on in 9.3.1 (facilities with
substantive water-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and/or opportunities),
select the proportion that have third party verified the water accounting aspect in
column 0.
• Select “Not relevant” if a water aspect is not relevant to any of your facilities. For
example, if all of your facilities have zero withdrawals and therefore there is no
water accounting data to verify for withdrawals-related rows.
• If a water aspect is only relevant to a proportion of your facilities, the calculation of
the % verified should be done considering only the facilities the water aspect is
relevant to. For example, if you have 5 facilities with substantive water-related
dependencies, impacts, risks and/or opportunities, and one of those does not have
221

any withdrawals or discharges, but the other 4 do, you should calculate the % of the
facilities that are verified out of those 4.
• If the accounting data at all facilities in your organization are verified, then you
would be able to select 76-100% here. However, if only a sample of your facilities
are verified, then you will need to check with your verifier on how many of the
facilities at risk were included and then calculate the proportion of all facilities
within your direct operations reported in 9.3.1 that this represents.
• If you select “Not verified” or “Not relevant”, column 2 will not be presented.
Please explain (column 3)
• Only presented if ‘Not verified’ or ‘Not relevant’ is selected in column 1.
• If ‘Not verified’ is selected, state the primary reasons for not verifying this water
accounting data related to this water aspect and your plans to do so within the next
two years.
• If ‘Not relevant’ is selected, state the primary reasons that data verification of this
water aspect is not relevant to your organization.
Explanation of terms • Third party verification: Verification conducted by an independent entity that does
not provide other services to the company (AFi, 2024).
• Verification: Assessment and confirmation of compliance, performance, and/or
actions relative to a stated commitment, policy, goal, target or other obligation.
Verification signifies that information is checked and confirmed by persons other
than those involved in the operation or entity being assessed (AFi, 2024).

Water efficiency and water intensity (CH, EU, FB, AC, MM, CO, OG only)
(9.5) Provide a figure for your organization’s total water withdrawal efficiency.
Question details
Change from last No change
year
Rationale A water withdrawal efficiency metric enables organizations to track the water-dependency of
their revenue, as well as bench mark their water use. Awareness of water efficiency can drive
cost savings, increased brand value, and product or service innovation.
This metric helps data users track an organization’s transition towards a water secure future.

999,999,999,999,999 using a maximum of two
[maximum 500 characters]

[Fixed row]
Requested content General:
• This metric is informed by SDG Indicator 6.4.1 – Water use efficiency.
Revenue (column 1)
• This figure should be in the same currency that you selected for all financial
information disclosed throughout your response in 1.2.
• Enter a numerical value for the revenue generated by your organization during the
reporting period disclosed in 1.4.
• This figure should align with the total revenue reported in your questionnaire set-up,
but it should be converted to the currency you selected in 1.2 if this was not USD.
Total water withdrawal efficiency (column 2)
• This column will be auto-calculated.
• The total withdrawal efficiency will be calculated using the revenue figure (column 1)
and the volume of total withdrawals figure given in 9.2.2 (column 1, row 1). Ensure
you have entered data into these columns.
Revenue
Volume of total withdrawals
226

Anticipated forward trend (column 4)
• Indicate the anticipated future trend of this figure, if known. Note that future trends
should be at least one year after the end of the reporting year provided in 1.4.
• Revenue: gross income arising from the operations of an organization over a period
Explanation of terms
of time.
• Water withdrawal: The sum of all water drawn into the boundaries of the
organization from all sources for any use over the course of the reporting period.
• Water withdrawal efficiency: A measure of economic value produced from water
withdrawals. For CDP disclosure, this is calculated as revenue per total water
withdrawal volume in the reporting period (informed by SDG indicator 6.4.1)
Additional information ‘Revenue’ in this calculation for water withdrawal efficiency refers to income arising in the
course of an entity's ordinary activities (less discounts, allowances and returns)
- before deducting costs for the goods/services sold and operating expenses to arrive at
profit. This marks a departure from SDG 6.4.1 and the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development’s guidance for corporate reporting against the SDG efficiency indicator, which
asks for Net Value Added – or revenue after deducting costs. This difference is to align with the
definition of revenue across CDP’s questionnaires, based on the International Financial
Reporting Standard.

Requested content General
• The rows presented in this table depend on your response to 1.22 and 1.23. Respond to
all rows individually.
• Columns 2 to 5 are only presented if “Yes” is selected in column 1.
• Provide details of the water intensity for the agricultural commodities that you produce.
This should be an organization-wide average value for each of the products. For a
single commodity, an organization may, however, have reasons to use different
metrics across their operations. Provide the most relevant metric for a product and a
justification of your choice in column 6 “Please explain”.
Agricultural commodity (column 0)
• Note that only the produced agricultural commodities that you indicated are significant
in terms of revenue in 1.22 and 1.23 will appear in the list.
234

Water intensity value (m3/denominator) (column 2)
• Provide your water intensity value. You should use cubic meters (m3) for the water
aspect.
• Note that this question requests a figure specific to your organization and the produced
commodity in column 0 (Agricultural commodity). This may be calculated by your
organization or by a third party. Do not report generic industry values.
Comparison with previous reporting year (column 5)
• CDP does not define the threshold for considering a value as “much higher” rather than
simply “higher” (or “much lower”/”lower”). CDP requests this information from many
different organizations with significant variations in water use.
• Define your own threshold for what is “much higher” (and “much lower”) and apply it
consistently so that each year the reported data for this question is comparable and
data users can track your water accounts more effectively. You should provide an
explanation for these thresholds that is specific to your organization in column 6
“Please explain”.
• If the data was not previously reported, but was collected, you may choose to indicate a
comparison with the previous year or select "This is our first year of measurement". In
either case, use the "Please explain" column to provide details about the information
reported.
Please explain (column 6)
• Provide details about the tools or methods used to collect/calculate water intensity.
• If you used the “Other commodity” row to report a different commodity in 1.23, specify
the name of the commodity produced by your organization.
• Provide any clarification needed for data users to understand your response:
• Please explain:
o Your choice of numerator for this product. If you excluded any water source
(e.g. rainwater) include this consideration and explain your rationale for doing
so;
o Your choice of denominator for this product; and
o The trend reported in column 5 and give an organization -specific explanation
of the thresholds used to provide the trend.
• Indicate the anticipated future trends, if known (note that future trends should be at
least one year after the end of reporting year provided in 1.4 ).
• Explain how the metric is used within your organization, e.g. to set specific targets
relating to water efficiency, to guide water strategy, to set remuneration incentives etc.
• Additionally, you may include any weighting you use in your calculation of the intensity
value to arrive at a more precise intensity value for an aggregate of countries/areas,
business units, products, etc. For example, this could be because of large variations in
intensity between different areas.
Explanation of terms • Water intensity: A metric providing the relationship between a volumetric aspect of
water and a unit of production, financial metric or any other unit.

Maize/corn Yes 1706 Freshwater Metric About the The value is the average
consumed tons same evapotranspiration from our maize fields,
weighted according to the production
volume in our farms. This reporting year
was a drier-than-average year. However,
we reduced the cultivated area and
maintained irrigation volumes to an
average of 2,100 m3/ha. This made that
the average water intensity value was
only 7% lower. We assume
decreases/increases in water intensity
values of 15% to be moderate. The total
freshwater consumed value includes the
consideration of rain and irrigation water
use. Rainwater use data is based on local
precipitation and soil data. We collect
these data to optimize irrigation, internally
benchmark our facilities and set priorities
for irrigation management investments.
Sugar Yes 146 Freshwater Metric Higher The value is the average
consumed tons evapotranspiration for our rainfed and
irrigated sugarcane, weighed according to
the production volume in our farms.
Average rainfed water intensity is 185
m3/t. Average irrigated water intensity is
146 m3/t. This reporting year was a drier-
than-average year, which lead us to
reduce irrigated area. Hence our average
water intensity was a 34% higher than the
previous year. We assume
decreases/increases in water intensity
values of 15% to be moderate. Irrigation
amounted to an average of 450 m3/ha in
comparison to 700 m3/ha in the previous
year. The total freshwater consumed
value includes the consideration of rain
and irrigation water use. Water use in the
sugar mill is not included in this figure.
We collect these data to optimize
irrigation, internally benchmark our
facilities and set priorities for irrigation
management investments. It also helps
us to set tighter targets to reduce our
water demand in water stressed areas.
Other, please Yes 1323 Freshwater Metric About The value is the average
specify: Beans consumed tons the same evapotranspiration, weighted according
to the production volume in our farms.
The values range from 1,670 to 1,025
m3/t. The ranges depend on local soil and
climate conditions. In our bean
production, we use supplementary
irrigation in drier years. This reporting
year was a drier-than-average year in
hydrological terms. This value excludes
water use in the processing facilities,
236

since it is less than 1% of the total
intensity figure. We use this data to
internally benchmark our facilities and
optimize irrigation.

Additionally, as part of our
engagement with the suppliers to
address other ESG issues like
deforestation we are focusing
engagement with suppliers
sourcing from Indonesia. In future
years we will work further to refine
the assessment of water intensity
and validate it with more local

consumption in the crop, not
considering water use or pollution
in the processing of the fruits.

• Provide your water intensity value. You must use m3 for the water aspect. For
example, water intensity = volume of water consumption in m3 / annual revenue in
$.
• Please state this in values of up to 4 decimal places.
Numerator: Water aspect (column 3)
• If you select “Other, please specify”, provide a label for the water aspect.
Denominator (column 4)
• You should provide a label for the denominator used in your calculation of the
water intensity value in column 2.
247

• Denominators vary by organization. For example, mining companies may use
“tonne of ore mined”, whereas for chemicals producers “m3 produced” may be
more appropriate.
Comment (column 5) (optional)
• Use this field to provide the units of your Numerator: Water aspect given in column
3.
• You can also give contextual information to support your water intensity
calculation. This may include explanations of:

alternative scope. Include your approach to this calculation and its rationale
and exclusions; such as how the data is collected/calculated, if there is any
weighing in the calculation of the average, etc.
o Relevant exclusions e.g. any exclusions to your selection in column 3
(Numerator: Water aspect), e.g. consideration only of freshwater use,
exclusion of rainwater use, and rationale for this.
• You can also provide a rationale for your choice of denominator (column 4) in this
column, as well as further describing the product you refer to in column 1.
• Requesting members may find it useful to understand how this data is used within
your organization e.g. in setting water efficiency targets, guiding water strategy, or
setting remuneration incentives.
Explanation of terms • Water consumption: The amount of water drawn into the boundaries of the
organization (or facility) and not discharged back to the water environment or
a third party over the course of the reporting period.
• Water intensity: A metric providing the relationship between a volumetric
aspect of water and a unit of production, financial metric or any other unit.
• Water withdrawal: The sum of all water drawn into the boundaries of the
organization (or facility) from all sources for any use over the course of the
reporting period.

Section overview
Section This section collects information on your organization’s water-related quantitative targets to
Overview demonstrate your commitment to progressing water stewardship and security, and to improving
water management.
In particular, setting and progressing targets to reduce water withdrawals, reduce water pollution,
and improve access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services is important for the
transition to a water secure future.

Rationale
Target setting plays a vital role in water management and assists the successful execution of
corporate strategies. Setting and making progress against targets helps decouple growth from
dependence on water. CDP data users wish to know about your organization’s tracked,
timebound, quantitative targets for achieving its water policy and commitments, improving
water management, and responding to current and future water risks.
Ambition
Companies have timebound, tracked, quantitative water-related targets for critical aspects of
their business operations, including water pollution, water withdrawals, and access to WASH
services.
253

Response options Select from:
• Yes
• No, but we plan to within the next two years
• No, and we do not plan to within the next two years
Requested content General
• Consider the range of water-related targets set within your organization and the
processes you have in place to ensure that they are meaningful and that their progress
and impact is monitored.
• Targets should have specific, measurable, quantitative outcomes. They may be related
to your organization’s direct operations or other parts of its value chain.
Explanation of terms • Target: A specific measurable output to be achieved within a specific timeline. Targets
often act as steps towards a wider and long-term corporate goal.
Additional information • The case for meaningful water targets that account for local context has been set
out in the following publication: Exploring the case for context-based water targets
(2017).
• Guidance for companies on how to set site-level water targets that reflect both the
local context and global shared goals for water use has been described in the
following publication: Setting Site Water Targets Informed by Catchment Context: A
Guide for Companies (2019).
This is the result of a collaborative effort between CDP, the CEO Water Mandate, the
Pacific Institute, the Nature Conservancy, UNEP-DHI, the World Resources Institute
and WWF.
• CDP is a partner of the Science Based Targets Network, responsible for developing
science-based targets for nature, including freshwater. This follows the successful
work of the Science-Based Targets initiative for greenhouse gas emissions in
mobilizing companies towards robust environmental impact reduction. Details can
be found here: Freshwater - Science Based Targets Network.

Requested General
content • This question requests information about your quantitative targets, which may or may not be
organization-wide. For example, a organization may have a commitment to improve water
efficiency that is implemented through locally specific targets and activities that together
contribute to a organization-wide target. Only report active targets or targets that have been
achieved, expired, replaced, or retired during the reporting year.
• To add targets, use the “Add Row” button. You may report up to 25 targets.
• Your base year figure , target year figure , and reporting year figure should be reported as
absolute numeric values in the unit used by your organization to monitor the target (e.g.,
megalitres, mg/L of chemical oxygen demand, proportion of suppliers etc.). The unit used
should be consistent in all three figures columns.
Target reference number (column 1)
• Select a target reference number from the drop-down list to allocate a unique identifier to your
target. This will allow you to track and report progress for this target in future disclosures to
CDP, until the target is retired. The target reference number is not specific to your
organization.
• When providing information from previously disclosed targets, be sure to use the same
reference number as in previous years. Targets should keep their reference number in
subsequent years. A target reference number may only apply to a single row.
Target coverage (column 2)
• Select “Organization -wide (direct operations only)”, if a target applies to your entire reporting
boundary, but is limited to your direct operations. Note that ‘organization -wide’ refers
collectively to all the companies, businesses, organizations, other entities or groups that fall
within your definition of the reporting boundary.
• If a target applies to both your direct operations and upstream value chain, select
“organization-wide (including suppliers)".
• If the target does not apply to the whole organization, select the option that best describes the
target coverage , and provide further details in the “Please explain” column. For example, if
your target applies only to your European operations, select “Country/area/region” in this
column and specify the country/area/region in the “Further details of target” column.
Category of target & Quantitative metric (column 3)
• The drop-down options in this column are presented based on your selections in 9.15.1 .
• Select the category of target and metric you wish to report. Some metrics are linked to more
than one category.
• Select the metric used to quantitatively track your progress against the target, or how your
organization measures the success of this target. If you select “Other, please specify,” provide
a label for the metric.
• Note that “category of target” refers to broad areas of water action in which targets can be set
and is not meant to capture further details of the target. Only select “Other, please specify” if
the category of target cannot be captured through any other response options.
Date target was set (column 4)
• Enter the date in which your organization set the target.
• This must be either before or during the reporting year, but cannot be after the reporting year
or after the end date of the target year.
• If you have a year-on-year rolling target or a maintenance target, enter the date you first set
the target. This can be before the base year.
• If you set the target based on financial years, enter the year that applies to the end of your
financial year
• If you do not know the exact date on which your company set the target, enter the end of the
year that the target was set.
261

End date of base year (column 5)
• The base year is the year against which you are comparing your target.
• The base year cannot be after your reporting year.
• If you have a year-on-year rolling target or a maintenance target, the base year will be the
previous reporting year.
• If you set the target based on financial years, enter the year that applies to the end of your
financial year
• If you have a target based on an average over a period of time (e.g., 5-year average), enter the
year that applies to the end of the average period.
Base year figure (column 6)
• Indicate the figure that you use as a baseline for your target. This should correspond to data
obtained during the base year and is the figure against which progress is measured.
• This figure will be used to auto-calculate the ‘% of target achieved relative to base year’ in
column 11.
End date of target year (column 7)
• This date represents when you expect to achieve your target.
• Enter the end date of the year that the target ends. For example, if the target is to reduce
withdrawals by 20% by the end of 2030, the end date of the target year is 31st December 2030.
• If you have a year-on-year rolling target or a maintenance target, the target year will be the
reporting year.
• If you have a target based on financial years, enter the end date of the year that applies to the
end of your financial year..
• You should not report any target that was completed before the start of the reporting year.
Target year figure (column 8)
• Enter the figure that you are aiming to achieve in the target year.
• This should not represent the metric’s percent increase or reduction, but the targeted figure
for the metric in the unit used to monitor it. For example, an organization has a target aiming
for a reduction of total water withdrawals by 20%, which translates to achieving withdrawals
of 800 megaliters compared to the ‘Base year figure’ of 1,000 megaliters. In this case, the
‘Target year figure’ would be 800 megaliters, not 20%.
• This figure will be used to auto-calculate the ‘% of target achieved relative to base year’ in
column 11.
Reporting year figure (column 9)
• Enter the figure achieved in the reporting year.
• This figure should be in the same units as the ‘Base year figure’ and ‘Target year figure’.
• This figure will be used to auto-calculate the ‘% of target achieved relative to base year’ in
column 11.
Target status in reporting year (column 10)
• New - Select this option for targets that have been set in the reporting year and are still in

In 2020, our organization set a target to reduce our total water
withdrawals by 50% by 2030. Progress is monitored using
megaliters as the unit of measurement. This target applies
company-wide with no exclusions in our direct operations, and is
expected to extend to our Tier 1 (direct) suppliers with a
substantive impact on water security as a contractual obligation
within the next 2 years. The motivation for the target stemmed from
a corporate objective on maximizing future cost savings (reduced
water bills, operational costs, and regulatory costs), while the target
is also in alignment with our water policy commitment to increase
freshwater availability in key river basins. As we have achieved 65%
already, we are on track to meet this target as long as progress
maintains present pace.
Zero Discharge of Hazardous In order to protect our brand value, in 2019 we set a target to
Chemicals (ZDHC) reduce the release of metal emissions to water in our operations in
the Ohio river basin. This target only applies to our sites with direct
discharges into water bodies, which are limited to our operations in
this basin. We are aiming to reduce the concentration of metal
emissions to 20% of the 2017 level by 2029, aka from 2.5g to 0.5g
per ton of copper output. Until this reporting year, we have achieved
75% of this target, and are on track to achieve the target by 2029.
Our company set a target in 2017, aiming to increase our revenue
from water efficient products by 20% within the next decade. Our
motivation lied in increasing our revenue and brand value through
the sales and promotion of water smart products. In 2017 our
‘smart appliances’ range comprised 7 different products of which 1
was equipped with a networked meter. By the current reporting
year, our ‘smart appliances’ range has been expanded to 15
products. Additionally, new models with improved efficiency have
been released for several of the products. Our revenues from ‘smart
appliances’ have already increased by 12%, putting us at 60% of the
target achieved..
We predict that by 2027 we will have 23 smart appliances on the
market and plan to have 10 of these equipped with monitoring
technology. In addition, 4 current products will be retired before
2027, giving us good confidence in our abilities as a company to
evolve and improve our smart appliances and to meet our target by
2027.

Module 10: Environmental Performance – Plastics
Module Tackling plastic pollution and waste is important for safeguarding our global marine, freshwater and
Overview terrestrial ecosystems, as well as our economies and communities.
This module includes questions on plastics-related targets and activities. There are also metrics for
plastic polymers, durable goods and components and plastics packaging on total weight, raw
material content and circularity potential (for packaging only). To cover the entire lifecycle of plastics,
there is also a question on the End-of-Life management.
These questions are informed by existing plastics disclosure frameworks, standards and guidelines
including the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the UN Environment Programme’s Global
Commitment framework, WWF ReSource Tracker, ESRS and GRI 306: Waste.
This provides decision makers with clear, comprehensive, and comparable data on the production,
commercialization, usage, and disposal of plastics across the global economy.

271

o The quantitative metric of the target and the quantitative baseline that progress is
measured against, e.g., a target to increase the proportion of plastic packaging that
is recyclable in practice and at scale from 65% to 95%;
o Rationale/motivation for setting the targets;
o Timeline for achievement of the targets;
o Coverage of the target, e.g., company-wide or limited to a geographic area,
business line etc.;
o Actions taken to deliver the targets and the progress achieved so far;
o How your targets relate to your long-term business strategy;
o How your targets relate to any extended producer responsibility schemes or other
external frameworks e.g., EMF and UN Environment Programme’s Global
Commitment.
• If you select a “No” response in column 1 “Targets in place”, explain why you have not set
plastics-related targets and any plans for future targets.
Explanation of • Circularity potential: the potential for products and materials to be reused, recycled,
terms composted or otherwise circulated in the economy and natural systems (adapted from EMF’s
Circular Economy Introduction).
• Compostable plastics: plastics which biodegrade under controlled conditions characterized
primarily by forced aeration and natural heat production from biological activity that degrades
the material. This process should align with ISO 170688.
• Extended Producer Responsibility: an environmental policy approach in which a producer’s
responsibility for a product is extended to the post-consumer stage of a product’s life cycle
(OECD).
• Hazardous substances: compounds exhibiting intrinsically negative properties such as being
persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT), very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB),
carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic for reproduction (CMR), or endocrine disruptors (ED)
(ZDHC, 2022).
• Plastics: material containing a polymer (a large chain molecule with repeating molecular
units) which can be moulded into a finished product - examples include thermoplastics,
polyurethanes, elastomers, thermosets, adhesives, coatings and sealants, and PP fibres. For
20243 CDP disclosure, synthetic rubber is included in our definition (informed by EMF’s report
‘The New Plastics Economy’).
• Plastic goods/products: goods and products are used interchangeably throughout. This
refers to any finished item made from the conversion of plastic polymers which is
manufactured or refined for commercialization or usage.
• Plastic packaging: packaging whose main structural element is plastic (corresponding to
50% of packaging weight). This should include fossil-based, biobased as well as compostable,
biodegradable, and oxo-degradable plastic. This also includes:
o Any plastic packaging that is (1) in direct contact with the product, (2) holding several
units of packaging, (3) used for the transport of units of packaging (i.e., primary,
secondary, and tertiary plastic packaging).
o Any plastic packaging applied to or offered to accompany any products sold (for
example, plastic shopping bags, plastic cutlery accompanying food, or crates used to
transport products).
(adapted from EMF’s Global Commitment definitions and reporting guidelines).
272

• Recycled content: proportion, by mass, of recycled material in a product. Only pre-consumer
and post-consumer materials shall be considered as recycled content (adapted from ISO
14021:2016).
o Pre-consumer recycled content: content that has been recycled
from materials diverted from the waste stream during a
manufacturing process (adapted from EMF’s Global Commitment
definitions and reporting guidelines).
o Post-consumer recycled content: content that has been
recycled from materials generated by households or by
commercial, industrial and institutional facilities in their role as
end users of the product which can no longer be used for its
intended purpose (adapted from EMF’s Global Commitment
definitions and reporting guidelines and ISO 14021:2016).
• Primary microplastics and plastic particles: small plastic particulates below 5 mm in size,
which are deliberately manufactured and added to products for specific purposes. For
example, as an abrasive agent, to control the thickness and appearance of a product or for
stability (adapted from Plastic Footprint Network and European Chemicals Agency).
• Problematic and unnecessary plastics: plastics that meet any of the following criteria:
o It is not reusable, recyclable or compostable;
o It contains, or its manufacturing requires, hazardous chemicals that pose a significant
risk to human health or the environment;
o It can be avoided (or replaced by a reuse model) while maintaining utility;
o It hinders or disrupts the recyclability or compostability of other items;
o It has a high likelihood of being littered or ending up in the natural environment.
(adapted from EMF’s Global Commitment definitions and reporting guidelines)
• Recyclable: the ability to reprocess, by means of a manufacturing process, a used material
into a product, a component incorporated into a product, or a secondary (recycled) raw
material; excluding energy recovery and the use of the product as a fuel (adapted from EMF’s
Global Commitment definitions and reporting guidelines and ISO 18604:2013).
• Recyclable ‘in practice and at scale’: successful post-consumer collection, sorting, and
recycling, which is proven to work in practice and at scale. The test and threshold for
assessment is a 30% recycling rate in multiple regions, collectively representing at least 400
million people. A possible alternative, especially relevant for more local players, is to check if a
30% post-consumer recycling rate is achieved in all the markets where a packaging is sold.
o ‘At scale’ means that the proof needs to be more than a lab test, a pilot, or a single
small region. It means that recycling of a certain product needs to be proven to work
in practice in multiple regions, collectively representing a significant geographical area
in terms of population size, ideally across different country and city archetypes.
o ‘In practice’ means that within each of these regions, the recycling system (end-to-end
system from consumer to recycled material) effectively recycles a significant share of
all products of that type put on the market.
(adapted from EMF’s Global Commitment definitions and reporting guidelines)
• Renewable content: proportion, by mass of material in a product, which is derived from
resources that are replenished at a rate equal to or greater than the rate of depletion (adapted
from EMF’s Circular Economy Glossary).
273

• Reusable packaging and reusable plastic products: packaging or a plastic product which
has been designed to and proves its ability to accomplish multiple trips or rotations in a
system for reuse after minimal processing (adapted from EMF’s Global Commitment
definitions and reporting guidelines).
• Single-use plastic products: a product that is made wholly or partly from plastic and that is
not conceived, designed or placed on the market to accomplish, within its life span, multiple
trips or rotations by being returned to a producer for refill or re-used for the same purpose for
which it was conceived (Single-Use Plastics Directive).
• Target: a specific measurable output to be achieved within a specific timeline. Targets often
act as steps towards a wider and long-term corporate goal.
• Virgin content: proportion, by mass of material in a product, which is derived from materials
that have not been previously used or subjected to processing other than for their original
production. In the context of plastic, virgin materials are materials not produced from post-
industrial or post-consumer recycled material (adapted from EMF’s Circular Economy
Glossary).

Explanation of • Circular economy: An economic system which eliminates waste and pollution,
terms circulates products and materials, and regenerates nature (adapted from EMF’s
Circular Economy Glossary).
• Circularity potential: the potential for products and materials to be reused, recycled,
composted or otherwise circulated in the economy and natural systems (adapted from
EMF’s Circular Economy Introduction).
• Recyclable ‘in practice and at scale’: successful post-consumer collection, sorting, and
recycling, which is proven to work in practice and at scale. The test and threshold for
assessment is a 30% recycling rate in multiple regions, collectively representing at least
400 million people. A possible alternative, especially relevant for more local players, is to
check if a 30% post-consumer recycling rate is achieved in all the markets where a
packaging is sold.
o ‘At scale’ means that the proof needs to be more than a lab test, a pilot, or a
single small region. It means that recycling of a certain product needs to be
proven to work in practice in multiple regions, collectively representing a
significant geographical area in terms of population size, ideally across different
country and city archetypes.
o ‘In practice’ means that within each of these regions, the recycling system (end-
to-end system from consumer to recycled material) effectively recycles a
significant share of all products of that type put on the market.

• Reusable packaging and reusable plastic products: packaging or a plastic product
which has been designed to and proves its ability to accomplish multiple trips or
rotations in a system for reuse after minimal processing (adapted from EMF’s Global
Commitment definitions and reporting guidelines).
• Technically recyclable: Technical recyclability considers the technical potential to
recycle a packaging, but does not take into account if the collection, sorting, and
recycling of the packaging happens in practice, at scale, and with reasonable
economics. Technically recyclable plastics must be made of plastic that is collected for
recycling, has a market value, and/or is supported by a legislatively mandated program.
(Note that some organizations refer to this as “packaging designed for recycling”.)

Explanation of • Composting (industrial/home): a process primarily characterized by forced aeration and
terms natural heat production from biological activity that degrades material. This can either be done
in an industrial facility or at home. Industrial composting processes must align with ASTM
D6400. Compostable plastics must align with ISO 17088.
• End-of-life management: the stage of the lifecycle where goods, materials and substances are
no longer in use and go through a management system to process them for preparation for
reuse, recycling, or disposal (adapted from European Environmental Bureau and Pew Charitable
Trusts).
• End-of-life management pathway: a generalized term used to describe the type of waste
treatment process goods, materials and substances undergo once they reach end-of-life.
• Incineration: the process of controlled, high-temperature combustion to destroy, render inert,
or reduce waste to ash. This excludes Waste to Energy (adapted from ISO 24161).
• Landfill: a permanent (i.e., more than one year) waste disposal site for the deposit of the waste
onto or into land (i.e., underground). This can also be internal, where a producer of waste is
carrying out their own waste disposal at the place of production (adapted from the Landfill
Directive).
289

• Leakage: the process of goods, materials or substances leaving the technosphere (human
environment) and accumulating in the natural environment (adapted from Plastic Footprint
Network).
• Mismanaged waste: goods, materials or substances that are either littered or inadequately
disposed. Inadequately disposed waste is not formally managed and includes disposal in
dumps or open, uncontrolled landfills, where it is not fully contained. Waste is also considered
mismanaged when its collection or disposal route creates a chance for it to be lost and
potentially released into the environment. This includes waste that is not appropriately
transported, collected, or stored (adapted from Jambeck et al., 2015 and IUCN The Marine
Plastic Footprint).
• Preparation for reuse: checking, cleaning, or repairing recovery operations, by which goods,
materials or substances that have reached end-of-life are prepared so that they can be re-used
without any other pre-processing (adapted from WRAP and the Waste Framework Directive).
• Production of plastics: Production refers to manufacturing processes used to make plastic
products. For example, for polymers this will refer to the polymerization process of monomers.
For durable goods, this could refer to processes such as injection molding to create desired
shapes and structures. For packaging, this could refer to processes of melting, extrusion and
sealing to form the plastic packaging.
• Recycling: any recovery operation by which waste materials are reprocessed into goods,
materials or substances for the original or other purposes. This excludes Waste to Energy
(adapted from ISO 15270 and the Waste Framework Directive).
• Waste to Energy: any waste treatment process designed to recover energy from waste in the
form of electricity or heat. This process is also called Energy Recovery (adapted from Plastic
Leak Project and UNFCCC).

Module 11: Environmental Performance – Biodiversity
Module overview
Module • The data disclosed in this module will help with the understanding of the interdependence
Overview between biodiversity and business resilience. Demand is increasing for biodiversity-related
data that will enable financial institutions to develop investment strategies, and to engage
effectively with organizations to address the loss of forests and biodiversity that is exposing
them to risk throughout their value chains.
• Disclosure on actions to preserve or improve biodiversity will help organizations to evaluate
the relevancy and efficacy of their commitments and consider the biodiversity-related risks
and impacts of their business practices.
• The module includes questions on exclusions, actions on commitments related to
biodiversity, biodiversity indicators, areas important for biodiversity, and land resourced and
land disturbed.
Sector-specific Additional questions on exclusions, resourced and disturbed land, artisanal and small-scale mining
content (ASM), biodiversity action plans (BAP), impacts on biodiversity, strategic business plans, biodiversity-
related targets, mitigation hierarchy, additional conservation actions, closure and rehabilitation of
mining projects and engagement activities for the Coal and Metals & Minning sectors.

Biodiversity indicator
(11.3) Does your organization use biodiversity indicators to monitor performance across its activities?
Question details
Change from last year No change
Rationale Robust indicators are critical for a corporate-level assessment of biodiversity impact, by
allowing the aggregation of data from different activities and geographies.
This question allows an organization to demonstrate its use of indicators to track progress
against its biodiversity goals and objectives and evaluate the success of its intervention/s.
Your response to this question aligns with requirements of “Stage 3: Indicators” in IUCN’s
Guidelines for planning and monitoring corporate biodiversity performance, which
recommends that companies collect, share and analyse biodiversity data that encourages
learning and improvement.
Response options Please complete the following table:

• Yes, we use indicators • State and benefit indicators
• No, we do not use indicators, but plan to • Pressure indicators

• No • Other, please specify
Requested content Indicators used to monitor biodiversity performance (column 2)
Select:
o State and Benefit indicators: for state indicators focusing on improving habitats
and species and benefit indicators that monitor ecosystem services goals.
o Pressure indicators: for pressure indicators that are effective for tracking objectives.
For example, a focus of a company objective on loss of habitats could have the
indicator ‘habitat cover change’ with data collected on trends in habitat cover loss.
o Response indicators: for response indicators that are informed by the company
strategy. For example, to establish the coverage of protected areas.
296

Explanation of terms • Biodiversity indicators: biodiversity indicators are communication tools that
summarize data on complex environmental issues. They can be used to signal key
issues to be addressed through policy or management interventions. Indicators,
therefore, are important for monitoring the status and trends of biological diversity
and, in turn, feeding back information on ways to continually improve the
effectiveness of biodiversity policies and management programmes (GreenFacts,
2006).
Additional information • For information on using indicators to assess biodiversity performance across
company activities, see IUCN’s Guideline for planning and monitoring corporate
biodiversity performance.
• For indicator(s) to be useful in a business application, they will need to take into
consideration an understanding of the natural system, and an idea of how the
system will respond to management (i.e., the indicator will provide a signal that can
be attributed to a business).
• Biodiversity indicators help us measure and monitor a) pressures or threats, such as
trends in land and water use, habitat loss or invasive species, b) the state of species
and ecosystems, such as the health of species or integrity of ecosystems, c) the
conservation response, such as the protection of important biodiversity areas,
and/or d) benefits to people, such as the ecosystem services that freshwater
provides. Fine scale indicators may be developed to inform local decisions on the
ground, such as determining the degree to which restoration or management
practices are working. Broad scale indicators that aggregate information may be
developed to report on the benefits of national environmental policy and
conservation investments (IUCN, 2021).
• Note: Organizations do not need to develop new indicators. There are several
existing indicators used by conservationists. Examples of good biodiversity
indicators include those developed for monitoring Aichi targets and the SDGs.
Existing indicators can be reviewed and appropriate ones selected.

• Activities are considered to be located near an area important for
biodiversity if the area is within the site/operation’s area of influence
i.e., the area within which the activities may directly and/or indirectly
cause impacts. For some sectors, such as metals and mining, it is
possible for impacts to be felt as far as 70km away (Sonter, L.J.,

any of your activities are located in or near this type of areas
important for biodiversity”, you may provide further details on the
difficulties obtaining data and what data you would need to perform
an assessment.
Explanation of • Area of influence: the area within which a mining project may potentially directly
terms and indirectly cause impacts. The area of direct impacts caused by mining-related
activities includes the physical mine site footprint, areas adjacent to the project site
that are affected by emissions and effluents, power transmission corridors,
pipelines, borrow and disposal areas, etc., and the area affected by associated
facilities that, although not part of the project that is being assessed, would not have
been constructed in the absence of the project. Areas indirectly affected by mining-
related activities include the physical footprint of non-project activities in the
surrounding area that are caused or stimulated by the project plus the area affected
by their emissions and effluents (IRMA, 2018, adapted from Gullison et al., 2015).
• Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs): sites contributing significantly to the global
persistence of biodiversity. They represent the most important sites for biodiversity
conservation worldwide, and are identified nationally using globally standardized
criteria and thresholds (IUCN 2016).
• Legally protected area: a clearly defined geographical space, recognized, dedicated
and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term
conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values
(IUCN, 2008). For the purposes of this CDP disclosure, only legally designated areas
299

(i.e., designated by governments) are expected to be disclosed (e.g. Natural 2000
network of protected areas).
• Ramsar sites: wetlands designated under the Convention on Wetlands of
International Importance (the Ramsar Convention).
Additional • For spatial information on areas important for biodiversity, please check the WWF
information Biodiversity Risk Filter. More specifically, the tool’s reputational risk contains a
selection of datasets to highlight if an organization’s activities are located near
areas important for biodiversity such as Protected Areas (based on UNEP-WCMC’s
World Database of Protected Areas WDPA), Key Biodiversity Areas, and Sites of
International Interest (i.e., UNESCO World Heritage Sites and Ramsar sites).

refers to activities:
o Leading to the deterioration of natural habitats and the
habitats of species, and to disturbance of the species for
which the protected area has been designated; and
o Where mitigation measures have not been implemented
accordingly.
• When assessing whether your activities could negatively affect
biodiversity, you should consider both:
o The direct impacts of physical sites, power transmission
corridors, pipelines, disposal areas, and associated facilities
that would not have been constructed in the absence of the
sites/operations; and
o The indirect impacts of any other activities associated
with the sites/operations and of emissions/effluents
released by the sites/operations.
Mitigation measures implemented within the selected area (column 10)
• This column is presented only if “Yes, but mitigation measures
have been implemented” is selected in column 9 “Indicate whether
any of your organization’s…”.
• The drop-down options are based on the mitigation hierarchy
referred to in the guide prepared by The Biodiversity Consultancy to
the Cross-Sector Biodiversity Initiative (CSBI, 2015):
o Site selection – relocation of the site or site components
away from an area recognized for its high biodiversity and
ecosystem services value.
o Project design – selection of the type of infrastructure,
and its placing and mode of operation on the site.
o Scheduling – changes in the timing of operational
activities.
o Physical controls – adaptation of the physical design of
the infrastructure to reduce potential impacts, such as
installing culverts on roads, or bird flight diverters on
transmission lines.
o Operational controls – management and regulation of
the actions of people associated with the site/operations —
including staff, contractors or (where feasible) project
affected people and migrants.
o Abatement controls – reduction of the levels of
pollutants (e.g. emissions of dust, light, noise, gases, or
303

liquids) that could have negative impacts on biodiversity and
ecosystem services.
o Restoration – the process of assisting the recovery of an
ecosystem, that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed
(SER, 2002).
o Biodiversity offsets – measures taken to compensate
for any residual significant, adverse impacts that cannot be
avoided, minimized and / or rehabilitated or restored, in order
to achieve no net loss or a net gain of biodiversity. Offsets
can take the form of positive management interventions
such as restoration of degraded habitat, arrested degradation
or averted risk, protecting areas where there is imminent or
projected loss of biodiversity (BBOP, 2012).

Explanation of Mining project area: the total area of land owned, leased or managed by the organization for a
terms given mining project, including areas that have not been disturbed by mining-related activities.
Mining-related activities: physical activities (e.g., land disturbance and clearing, road building,
sampling, airborne surveys, facility construction, ore removal, ore processing, waste management,
reclamation, etc.) carried out during any phase of the mine life cycle (planning, impact assessment,
exploration, mine construction, mining, mine closure, post-closure) (IRMA, 2018).
Land disturbed: land where substantial disruption of pre-existing habitats and land cover occurred,
including physical and chemical alteration (Adapted from GRI, 2013).
Modified Habitat: modified habitats are areas that may contain a large proportion of plant and/or
animal species of non-native origin, and/or where human activity has substantially modified an
area’s primary ecological functions and species composition. This excludes habitat that has been
308

converted in anticipation of the project. Modified habitats may include areas managed for
agriculture, forest plantations, reclaimed coastal zones, and reclaimed wetlands (IFC, 2012).
Natural Habitat: natural habitats are areas composed of viable assemblages of plant and/or
animal species of largely native origin, and/or where human activity has not essentially modified an
area’s primary ecological functions and species composition (IFC, 2012).

Environmental Issue Question level B
(Theme)
Questionnaire sector Question level M-B only
Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM)
(11.6) Are there artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) operations active in your mining project areas or in
their area of influence?
Question details
Change from last
No change
year
Rationale It is not unusual that large-scale mining projects come across artisanal and small-scale miners
within their area of influence. Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) provides a source of
livelihood for thousands of people but might also be associated with conflicts and environmental
degradation, such as tropical deforestation. This data informs investors and other data users
about potential challenges and risks you may be facing.
Response options
Select one of the following options:
● Yes
● No
● Data not available
Requested
General
content
• If artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) operations occur in your mining project areas or
in their areas of influence, select “Yes”. You will be able to provide details in the following
question 11.6.1 and in 11.19.
• Select “No” if there are no ASM operations active in your mining project areas or in their
areas of influence.
• Also select “No” if ASM operations in the area of influence of your projects are small and/or
occasional, with no potential to affect or be affected by your mining projects.
309

• Select “Data not available” if data on ASM is not collected by your organization at the
corporate level.
Explanation of Area of influence: the area within which a project may potentially directly and indirectly cause
terms impacts. The area of direct impacts caused by mining-related activities includes the physical
mine site footprint, areas adjacent to the project site that are affected by emissions and
effluents, power transmission corridors, pipelines, borrow and disposal areas, etc., and the
area affected by associated facilities that, although not part of the project that is being
assessed, would not have been constructed in the absence of the project. Areas indirectly
affected by mining-related activities include the physical footprint of non-project activities in
the surrounding area that are caused or stimulated by the project plus the area affected by
their emissions and effluents (IRMA, 2018, adapted from Gullison et al. 2015).
Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM): formal or informal mining operations with
predominantly simplified forms of exploration, extraction, processing, and transportation. ASM
is normally low capital intensive and uses high labor-intensive technology. ASM can include
men and women working on an individual basis as well as those working in family groups, in
partnership, or as members of cooperatives or other types of legal associations and
enterprises involving hundreds or even thousands of miners. For example, it is common for
workgroups of 4-10 individuals, sometimes in family units, to share tasks at one single point of
mineral extraction (e.g. excavating one tunnel). At the organizational level, groups of 30-300
miners are common, extracting jointly one mineral deposit (e.g. working in different tunnels),
and sometimes sharing processing facilities (OECD, 2016).
Mining project area: the total area of land owned, leased or managed by the organization for a
given mining project, including areas that have not been disturbed by mining-related activities.

Question details
Change from last
No change
year
Rationale The number of mining organizations adopting Biodiversity Action Plans (BAPs) in sites with high
biodiversity risk is increasing. Developing BAPs in such cases can be seen as good practice and
it might also be needed to demonstrate compliance with lender standards/requirements. BAPs
complement existing environmental management systems, focusing on the organization’s
biodiversity management strategy. Developing BAPs for high-risk sites provides an indication to
investors and other data users that the organization is tackling its biodiversity risks.
Response options
Select one of the following options:
• Yes
• No
Requested General
content
• If your organization adopts a BAP as an instrument to manage biodiversity impacts and risks,
select “Yes”.
• If your organization adopts different terminology (e.g., Biodiversity Management Plan or
Ecological Management Plan) but it still fits the definition adopted by CDP for BAP, also
select “Yes”.
• Select “No” if your organization does not adopt BAPs. This option should be selected even if
none of your sites are considered to face relevant biodiversity risks.
Explanation of Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP): a plan to manage potential risks to changes in biodiversity or
terms ecosystem services arising from environmental aspects of assets and activities; it lists the
actions to take to conserve or enhance biodiversity (CSBI, 2015).

Explanation of Significant impact on biodiversity: impact that can adversely affect the integrity of a geographic
terms area or region, either directly or indirectly, by substantially changing its ecological features,
structures, and functions across its whole area, and over the long term, so that habitat, its
population levels, and the particular species that make the habitat important cannot be
sustained. On a species level, a significant impact causes a population decline or change in
distribution so that natural recruitment (reproduction or immigration from unaffected areas)
cannot return to former levels within a limited number of generations. A significant impact can
also affect subsistence or commercial resource use to the degree that the well-being of users
is affected over the long term (GRI, 2018)

o Unlikely: may occur at some time;
o Rare: only in exceptional circumstances.
Describe response (column 7)
• Use this section to provide details on how your organization has managed the impact, detailing
your approach, stakeholders involved and outcomes to date.
Explanation of Consequence: consequence is assessed in terms of how impacts alter the viability of a
terms biodiversity value (in other words, the ability of a biodiversity value to persist over time). The
viability of a biodiversity value is a function of its irreplaceability and vulnerability.
Irreplaceability relates to the number of sites or the geographic extent where the value is
present; if a biodiversity value (for example, a rare habitat type) occurs only at a few sites, then
it is highly irreplaceable. Vulnerability relates to the impact and likelihood of existing and future
threats; a vulnerable biodiversity value is one that has experienced rapid loss over recent
history and/or is faced by current threats that will lead to rapid loss ( (Hardner et. al., 2015)
Conservation status: Least Concern (LC), Near Threatened (NT), Vulnerable (VU), Endangered
(EN), Critically Endangered (CR) and Extinct in the Wild (EW) are categories of global extinction
risk, based on the IUCN Red List classification system. Species classified as VU, EN and CR
are considered to be threatened species. For details see: https://www.iucnredlist.org.
Critical habitat: critical habitats are areas with high biodiversity value, including (i) habitat of
significant importance to Critically Endangered and/or Endangered species; (ii) habitat of
significant importance to endemic and/or restricted-range species; (iii) habitat supporting
globally significant concentrations of migratory species and/or congregatory species; (iv)
highly threatened and/or unique ecosystems; and/or (v) areas associated with key
evolutionary processes ( (IFC, 2012)
Natural habitat: natural habitats are areas composed of viable assemblages of plant and/or
animal species of largely native origin, and/or where human activity has not essentially
modified an area’s primary ecological functions and species composition ( (IFC, 2012)
320

Significant impact on biodiversity: impact that can adversely affect the integrity of a geographic
area or region, either directly or indirectly, by substantially changing its ecological features,
structures, and functions across its whole area, and over the long term, so that habitat, its
population levels, and the particular species that make the habitat important cannot be
sustained. On a species level, a significant impact causes a population decline or change in
distribution so that natural recruitment (reproduction or immigration from unaffected areas)
cannot return to former levels within a limited number of generations. A significant impact can

Explanation of Biodiversity-related issues: for the purpose of this questionnaire, this refers to business impacts
terms and dependencies on biodiversity. This includes direct and indirect impacts leading or
contributing to biodiversity loss (e.g., habitat degradation and species loss), as well as risks
associated with the business’ dependencies on biodiversity (e.g., regulatory and reputational
risks).
Business objectives: these describe what the organization expects to accomplish over a specified
time period, and typically include a statement of purpose and anticipated future state for the
organization.
Financial planning: includes outlining the actions, assets, and resources necessary to meet an
organization’s objectives and strategic goals. It is not limited to just creating a “financial plan”,
but also includes long-term capital allocations that will go beyond the typical 3-5 year financial
plan (e.g., investment, research and development, manufacturing, and markets) (TCFD, 2017).
Strategy: refers to an organization’s anticipated future state. The strategy creates a benchmark
against which the organization can monitor and measure its progress in reaching that desired
state. The strategy design can involve reviewing the motive and scope behind the
organization’s activities and the nature of its businesses, considering the risks and
opportunities it faces and the environment in which it operates (TCFD, 2017).

significant adverse impacts on biodiversity?
Question details
Change from last
No change
year
Rationale Actions to mitigate impacts on biodiversity can be more effective and efficient if adopted at the
early stages of the project. Later, mitigation measures are often more limited, costly and involve
a higher degree of uncertainty about expected outcomes. Managing relevant impacts and risks
by means of avoidance and minimization indicates to investor and other data users that your
organization is aligned with sector best practices, as well as being more likely to prevent
unforeseen risks.
Response options
Select one of the following options:
• Yes
326

• No
Requested
General
content
• In this question, your organization is asked to disclose whether you have adopted at least one
of the first two steps of the mitigation hierarchy framework: avoidance and minimization.
• Select ‘Yes’ if you are able to provide relevant examples of avoidance and/or minimization
actions, even if your organization has not made a public commitment specifically on the
mitigation hierarchy.
• Organizations that have committed to implement the mitigation hierarchy framework in 11.10
are expected to indicate that avoidance and/or minimization have been adopted as strategies
to mitigate biodiversity impacts and risks.
Explanation of Avoidance: measures taken to anticipate and prevent adverse impacts on biodiversity before
terms actions or decisions are taken that could lead to such impacts (CSBI, 2015).
Minimization: measures taken to reduce the duration, intensity, significance and/or extent of
impacts (including direct, indirect and cumulative impacts, as appropriate) that cannot be
completely avoided, as far as is practically feasible. (Minimize as used here does not imply an
intention to ‘reduce to zero’, which is its legal meaning in some jurisdictions. Some
organizations have chosen to avoid using the words ‘minimize’/’minimization’ and instead use
words like ‘limit’/’limitation’ and ‘reduce’/’reduction’.) (CSBI, 2015).
Mitigation hierarchy: the sequence of actions to anticipate and avoid impacts on biodiversity and
ecosystem services; and where avoidance is not possible, minimize; and, when impacts occur,
rehabilitate or restore; and where significant residual impacts remain, offset (CSBI, 2015).
Significant impact on biodiversity: impact that can adversely affect the integrity of a geographic
area or region, either directly or indirectly, by substantially changing its ecological features,
structures, and functions across its whole area, and over the long term, so that habitat, its
population levels, and the particular species that make the habitat important cannot be
sustained. On a species level, a significant impact causes a population decline or change in
distribution so that natural recruitment (reproduction or immigration from unaffected areas)
cannot return to former levels within a limited number of generations. A significant impact can
also affect subsistence or commercial resource use to the degree that the well-being of users
is affected over the long term (GRI, 2018).
Additional For more information on the mitigation hierarchy, refer to the guide prepared by The Biodiversity
information Consultancy to the Cross-Sector Biodiversity Initiative – CSBI (CSBI, 2015).

Approach and type of measure (column 2)
• Please consider the following when selecting the most suitable option (CSBI, 2015):
o Avoidance through site selection: involves the relocation of the project site or components
away from an area recognized for its high biodiversity and ecosystem services value.
o Avoidance through project design: takes place when selecting the type of infrastructure,
and its placing and mode of operation on the project site.
o Avoidance through scheduling: is achieved through changes in the timing of project
activities.
o Minimization through physical controls: adapting the physical design of project
infrastructure to reduce potential impacts, such as installing culverts on roads, or bird flight
diverters on transmission lines.
o Minimization through operational controls: managing and regulating the actions of people
associated with the project — including staff, contractors or (where feasible) project-
affected people and migrants.
o Minimization through abatement controls: taking steps to reduce levels of pollutants (e.g.
emissions of dust, light, noise, gases or liquids) that could have negative impacts on
biodiversity and ecosystem services.

Rationale Restoration of biodiversity features is an option for compensating impacts that could not be
avoided or minimized. It is an important step for organizations to achieve their commitments
regarding reducing their impact on biodiversity (e.g. ‘No Net Loss’ or ‘Net Positive Impact’), and to
manage regulatory and reputational risks. By indicating that you are taking action to reduce
residual impacts, you provide an indication to investors and other stakeholders that your
organization is adopting biodiversity management best practices.

Explanation of Averted loss offset: designed to protect biodiversity in an area demonstrated to be under threat of
terms imminent or projected loss (due to factors unrelated to the development project in question)
(CSBI, 2015).
Biodiversity offset: measures taken to compensate for any residual significant, adverse impacts
that cannot be avoided, minimized and / or rehabilitated or restored, in order to achieve no net
loss or a net gain of biodiversity. Offsets can take the form of positive management
interventions such as restoration of degraded habitat, arrested degradation or averted risk,
protecting areas where there is imminent or projected loss of biodiversity (BBOP, 2012).
Compensation agreements: biodiversity offset implemented by a third-party under a specified
regulatory framework.
Residual impact: the remaining adverse impact on biodiversity after appropriate avoidance,
minimization and rehabilitation measures have been taken according to the mitigation
hierarchy (BBOP, 2012).
Restoration offset: designed to remediate past damage to biodiversity (due to factors unrelated
to the development project in question) by making positive conservation management
interventions, such as the rehabilitation or enhancement of biodiversity components (or even
recreation of ecosystems and their associated biodiversity values) at suitable offset sites
(CSBI, 2015).

Explanation of
terms
Area of influence: the area within which a project may potentially directly and indirectly cause
impacts. The area of direct impacts caused by mining-related activities includes the physical
mine site footprint, areas adjacent to the project site that are affected by emissions and
effluents, power transmission corridors, pipelines, borrow and disposal areas, etc., and the
area affected by associated facilities that, although not part of the project that is being
assessed, would not have been constructed in the absence of the project. Areas indirectly
affected by mining-related activities include the physical footprint of non-project activities in
the surrounding area that are caused or stimulated by the project plus the area affected by
their emissions and effluents (IRMA, 2018, adapted from Gullison et al. 2015).
Restoration: is the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded,
damaged, or destroyed (SER, 2002).

Requested General
content
• Please note that rehabilitation here is different from restoration; Rehabilitation aims to reinstate
land productivity and ecosystem functionality, but it might assume a different land-use and
species composition from the original ecosystem. The new ecosystem may be simpler in
structure than the original but more productive, such as when a woodland is replaced with a
plantation or grazing land or vice versa. (see “Explanation of Terms”).
Disclosing area rehabilitated (in total and in the reporting year)? (column 1)

• Select “Yes” if you can disclose the total area rehabilitated for your mining projects that are
either in “Production” or “Closure and/or legacy site” stages, as specified in 1.18.
• Select “Partially” if data is only partially available.
• If “Yes” or “Partially” is selected, you will be asked to provide details in 11.17.1.
Comment (column 2)
• If you selected “No” or “Partially”, use this column to provide an explanation on why you are not
disclosing complete data on rehabilitation (e.g., data not collected at the corporate level).
Explanation of Rehabilitation: the return of disturbed land to a stable, productive and self-sustaining condition,
terms after taking into account beneficial uses of the site and surrounding land. Reinstatement of
degrees of ecosystem structure and function where restoration is not the aspiration i.e.
rehabilitation may not aim to replicate the original fauna and flora of an ecosystem (DIIS,

Rationale This question asks about actions your organization is undertaking to manage risks associated
with artisanal and small-scale miners within your mining project areas or in the area of influence
of your mining projects. Developing effective ways of engaging with artisanal and small-scale
mining (ASM) helps your mining projects to keep their social license to operate, e.g., by
preventing conflicts or contributing to reducing environmental harm. This will provide insights to
investors and other data users on your risk management approach for ASM.

General
content
• Select “Yes” if your organization engages with artisanal and small-scale miners operating in its
mining project areas or in their areas of influence. You will be able to provide details in 11.19.1.
• Select “No” if your organization does not engage with artisanal and small-scale miners
operating in its mining project areas or in their areas of influence.
Explanation of Area of influence: the area within which a project may potentially directly and indirectly cause
terms impacts. The area of direct impacts caused by mining-related activities includes the physical
mine site footprint, areas adjacent to the project site that are affected by emissions and
effluents, power transmission corridors, pipelines, borrow and disposal areas, etc., and the
area affected by associated facilities that, although not part of the project that is being
assessed, would not have been constructed in the absence of the project. Areas indirectly
affected by mining-related activities include the physical footprint of non-project activities in
the surrounding area that are caused or stimulated by the project plus the area affected by
their emissions and effluents (IRMA, 2018, adapted from Gullison et al. 2015).
Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM): formal or informal mining operations with
predominantly simplified forms of exploration, extraction, processing, and transportation. ASM
is normally low capital intensive and uses high labor intensive technology. ASM can include
men and women working on an individual basis as well as those working in family groups, in
partnership, or as members of cooperatives or other types of legal associations and
enterprises involving hundreds or even thousands of miners. For example, it is common for
work groups of 4-10 individuals, sometimes in family units, to share tasks at one single point
of mineral extraction (e.g. excavating one tunnel). At the organizational level, groups of 30-300
miners are common, extracting jointly one mineral deposit (e.g. working in different tunnels),
and sometimes sharing processing facilities (OECD, 2016).
Mining project area: the total area of land owned, leased or managed by the organization for a
given mining project, including areas that have not been disturbed by mining-related activities.

General
content
• Note that this question is not asking you to provide an extensive list of engagement activities
your organization carried out during the reporting year.
• You should provide examples of engagement that resulted in a substantive positive impact on
biodiversity and of a wide geographical coverage. For example, if a global company only
mentions engagement activities related to its operation in Canada, this is not considered to be
an adequate geographical representation.
• If you have operations in countries/areas of high-deforestation risk, it is desirable that you
disclose examples related to deforestation and/or forest degradation, if available.
Activities (column 1)
• This list of activities is exemplificative. Select the option that best represents your engagement
with other stakeholders.
• If any other activities are carried out, select “Other, please specify”. Provide further details in
column 3 “Please explain”.
Mining project ID (column 2)
• When referring to a specific mining project, please make sure you select the same mining
project identifier as in 1.18. For example, “Project 1” here should refer to the same mining
project that was attributed to the “Project 1” identifier in 1.18.
• If similar engagement activities occur in more than one mining project, select all that apply.
Please explain (column 3)
• Provide details on your organization’s motivation for developing the specified engagement
activity and why it is relevant in the context of the selected mining projects.
• Describe the nature of the engagement activity and stakeholders involved, including relevant
quantified outcomes to biodiversity and/or ecosystem service provision.
Explanation of Stakeholder: persons or groups who are or could be directly or indirectly affected by a project or
terms activity (OECD, 2017).

Environmental impact of portfolio and emissions breakdown (FS only)
(12.1) Does your organization measure the impact of your portfolio on the environment?
Question details
Question
This question appears for organizations in the Financial Services sector who report in 1.10 that
dependencies
they undertake banking, investing and “General(non-life)” insurance underwriting activities. The
question does not appear for organizations who report that they only insure “Life and/or Health”.
Rows are presented according to the reported organizational activities.
Change from last Modified guidance
year
Rationale Most of financial institutions’ impact on the environment occurs in their portfolios, within the
financial products and services they provide and/or in their investments that enable activities
which have impact on the environment. Organizations in this sector should measure their
portfolio impact using specific metrics to understand the impact their financial activities have on
the environment and manage it properly. This question informs investors and other data users
about the extent to which organizations understand their portfolios’ environmental impact.
Ambition • Financial institutions understand and manage the impact they have on the environment
through measuring the impact each of their portfolios has on the different environmental
themes.

Explanation of • Financed emissions: the absolute greenhouse gas emissions associated with a portfolio,
terms expressed in tons CO2e. For financial institutions, the indirect emissions caused by their
financing activities are relevant and their emissions inventory would be incomplete without
accounting for them. The GHG Protocol classifies these emissions in Scope 3 Category 15
Investments. They are also known as portfolio emissions or financed emissions. Put simply,
they are emissions that occur at sources owned or controlled by other companies, but which
are made possible because those companies are financed by the investment and lending of
financial institutions; and therefore are indirect to the financial institution and should be
included in the financial institution’s Scope 3 inventory.
• Other carbon footprinting and/or exposure metrics: Metrics organizations in the financial
sector can use to understand how their financial portfolio impacts the climate, as identified by
the TCFD and to be used alongside portfolio emission metrics:
o Carbon intensity: Volume of carbon emissions per million dollars of revenue
(carbon efficiency of a portfolio), expressed in tons CO2e/Million revenue (in unit
currency).
o Weighted average carbon intensity: Portfolio’s exposure to carbon-intensive
companies, expressed in tons CO2e/Million revenue. This is the metric
recommended by the TCFD.
o Portfolio carbon footprint: Total carbon emissions for a portfolio normalized by
the market value of the portfolio, expressed in tons CO2e/Million invested.
• Portfolio: in the context of this questionnaire your portfolio is your entire collection of the core
financing activities and insurance policies that you offer. For banking, this is the entire
collection of products, securities and loans held on your balance sheet for which you own the
receivable stream. For asset managers, this is the entire collection of your products and
investments that you hold and/or manage on behalf of your clients. For asset owners, this is
the entire collection of products, funds and investments owned and controlled by your
company. For investment portfolios, asset managers should consider discretionary
investments, those where the company has discretion over investment decision. For
insurance underwriting, this is the entire collection of products and insurance policies you
provide to your clients.
• Portfolio impact: impact of financial activities, namely lending, investment and insurance
underwriting, on the environment.

(12.1.1) Provide details of your organization's financed emissions in the reporting year and in the base year.
Question details
Question This question only appears if you select "Yes" in column 1 “We measure the impact of our
dependencies portfolio on the climate” and "Financed emissions" in column 2 “Disclosure metric” of 12.1.
Change from last No change

Rationale GHG emissions accounting is one of the primary metrics organizations in the financial sector
can use to understand how their portfolio impacts the climate. In addition to highlighting risks
and opportunities, portfolio emissions disclosure is a pre-requisite for financial institutions to
measure improvements in the climate performance of their portfolios, and measure progress
towards the net zero commitments that are increasingly being made.
IMPORTANT NOTE:
This question asks you to disclose your financed emissions (also known as Scope 3 Category 15
“Investments” total absolute emissions). For organizations in the financial sector, Scope 3
Category 15 “Investments” total absolute emissions has been pulled out of question 7.8 as the
majority of emissions occur in the investment chain, in relation to financial products and services
and/or investments. Portfolio emissions (or Scope 3 Category 15 “Investments” total absolute
emissions as defined by the GHG Protocol) is the most relevant category to financial services
organizations.
In this question, organizations in the financial sector are only requested to disclose their Scope 3
Category 15 “Investments” total absolute emissions, Categories 1-14 and if applicable other
upstream or downstream scope 3 emissions should be disclosed in 7.8.
Ambition • Financial institutions monitor and manage climate-related risks by measuring and
disclosing the emissions associated with their financing, also known as “financed
emissions”.
• Financial institutions disclose the methodology used to calculate the financed emissions,
including the method of allocation the organization uses to attribute its share of emissions
in relation to the value of its total assets as well as the total amount of assets/gross
exposure included in the financed emissions disclosure and any exclusions from the
calculation.

• Metrics other than absolute emissions (in tCO2e) should not be reported in this question, and
should be reported in 12.1.3.
• For example, weighted average carbon intensities (WACI) should be reported in 12.1.3.
Portfolio (column 0)
• The options which appear are driven by the activities you selected in 1.10.
• You are requested to complete all rows in this table.
Financed emissions (metric unit tons CO2e) in the reporting year (column 2)
• Use gross figures for reporting absolute emissions, not net figures. For funded amounts, gross
exposure shall be calculated as the funded carrying amounts (before subtracting the loss
allowance, when applicable), whether prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting
Standards or other GAAP.
• Enter the emissions in metric unit tons CO2e, entering numbers only up to 99,999,999,999
without commas and up to three decimal places.
• Negative numbers are not allowed as reporting needs to be gross, not net figures. Emission
figures should be for the reporting year only.
• Entering 0 implies that you have measured and calculated emissions from this source and
they are equal to zero.
% of portfolio covered in relation to total portfolio value (column 3)
• Enter the percentage of portfolio value that has been covered by the financed emissions
calculation to the portfolio value based on the assets value reported in 1.10.
Total value of assets included in the financed emissions calculation (column 4)
• The value will be auto calculated based on the percentage provided in column 2 “Financed
emissions (metric unit tons CO2e) in the reporting year” and the portfolio value based on
assets value reported for the corresponding portfolio in question 1.10.
% of financed emissions calculated using data obtained from clients/investees (optional) (column 5)
• Such data obtained from value chain partners (clients or investees) may take the form of
primary activity data or emissions data calculated by value chain partners. More information
on this can be found in Chapter 7, Collecting Data, of the GHG Protocol’s Corporate Value
Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard.

Weighted data quality score (for PCAF-aligned data quality scores only) (column 7)
• If you are using the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) quality score for
your data, enter the relevant score (from 1 to 5).
• A score of 1 reflects the best quality data and means that the investee company has
performed an emissions calculation that has been verified by a third-party auditor. A score of
5 is the lowest and estimates the emissions of the investee company based on sector and
region averages or benchmarks.
Financed emissions (metric unit tons CO2e) in the base year (column 8)
• The base year is the year against which you are comparing your financed emissions.
• The base year cannot be after the reporting year.
• Enter the emissions in metric unit tons CO2e, entering numbers only up to 99,999,999,999
without commas and up to three decimal places.
• Negative numbers are not allowed as reporting needs to be gross, not net figures. Emission
figures should be for the reporting year only.
• Entering 0 implies that you have measured and calculated emissions from this source and
they are equal to zero.
Base year end (column 9)
• The base year is the year against which you are comparing your financed emissions.
• The base year cannot be after the reporting year.
• The start date of the base year will automatically be assumed to be exactly 365 days before
the listed end date. For example, if you enter an end date of 31/12/2023, the start date of the
base year will automatically be assumed to be 01/01/2023.
% of undrawn loan commitments included in the financed emissions calculation. (column 10)
• Disclose separately the percentage of undrawn loan commitments included in the financed
emissions calculation.
• For portfolios that don’t have any undrawn loan commitments enter 0 as a response.
Please explain the details of and assumptions used in your calculation (column 11)
• Include the following information:
o The method of allocation the entity used to attribute its share of emissions in
relation to the size of its gross exposure;
o The portfolios and/or asset classes that have been excluded from the
calculation and the reasons for excluding them;
o If a portfolio or an asset class is not fully covered in the calculation, explain the
exclusion and the reasons for not covering 100% of it;
o The scopes considered when measuring emissions associated with assets in
your portfolio;
o The sources of data if primary data was used in calculating portfolio emissions;
o The approach taken to modelling or estimating emissions when primary data
was not used; and
o Any assumptions used in the calculation.

Explanation of Financed emissions: The absolute greenhouse gas emissions associated with a portfolio,
terms expressed in tons CO2e. For financial institutions, the indirect emissions caused by their financing
activities are relevant and their emissions inventory would be incomplete without accounting for
them. The GHG Protocol classifies these emissions in Scope 3 Category 15 Investments. They are
also known as portfolio emissions or financed emissions. Put simply, they are emissions that occur
at sources owned or controlled by other companies, but which are made possible because those
companies are financed by the lending and investment of financial institutions; and therefore are
indirect to the financial institution and should be included in the financial institution’s Scope 3
inventory

Rationale This question acknowledges that in addition to GHG emissions accounting, there are a number
of other metrics organizations in the financial sector can use to understand how their portfolio
impacts the environment. Metrics for measuring portfolio impact on forests, water and
biodiversity are in their infancy, so this question allows financial institutions to explain how they
assess the impact of their portfolio on the environment. This question allows you to express the
impact of your portfolio on the environment using other metrics identified by the TCFD or other
leading environmental frameworks and standards.
Ambition Financial services companies measure and disclose the impact of their portfolios on the
environment.

• If you wish to provide any additional context to your calculation, including any exclusions
within your portfolio, you can also do that in this column.
Explanation of • Avoided emissions: the reduction in emissions achieved by a project compared to a baseline
terms of what would have been emitted in the absence of the project. Project financing for
renewable energy projects such as wind or solar energy generation are common, and achieve
avoided emissions compared to energy generation using fossil fuels.
• (Portfolio) carbon footprint: total carbon emissions for a portfolio normalized by the
market value of the portfolio, expressed in tons CO e/$M invested.
2
• Carbon intensity: volume of carbon emissions per million dollars of revenue (carbon
efficiency of a portfolio), expressed in tons tCO2e/Million revenue.
• Carbon removals: CO sequestered or removed from the atmosphere and stored, preventing
2
its harmful global warming effect.
• Conversion: loss of a natural ecosystem as a result of its replacement with agriculture or
another land use, or due to a profound and sustained change in the natural ecosystem’s
species composition, structure, or function.
o Deforestation is one form of conversion (conversion of natural forests)
o Conversion includes severe degradation or the introduction of management
practices that result in a profound and sustained change in the ecosystem’s
species composition, structure, or function.
o Change to natural ecosystems that meets this definition is considered to be
conversion regardless of whether or not it is legal (AFi, 2024).
• Cutoff date: the date after which deforestation or conversion renders a given area or
production unit non-compliant with no-deforestation or no-conversion, commitments, policies,
goals, targets, or other obligations (AFi, 2024).
• Deforestation: loss of natural forest as a result of: i) conversion to agriculture or other non-
forest land use; ii) conversion to a tree plantation; or iii) severe and sustained degradation.
o Severe and sustained degradation (scenario iii in the definition) constitutes
deforestation even if the land is not subsequently used for non-forest land use.
o Loss of natural forest that meets this definition is considered to be deforestation
regardless of whether or not it is legal.
o The definition of deforestation signifies “gross deforestation” of a natural forest
where "gross" is used in the sense of "total; aggregate; without deduction for
reforestation or other offset." (adapted from AFi,2024).
• Deforestation- and conversion-free (also referred to as "no-conversion"): commodity
production, sourcing, or financial investments that do not cause or contribute to deforestation
and the conversion of natural ecosystems.
o Conversion-free refers to no gross conversion of natural ecosystems, which the
Accountability Framework specifies as the appropriate policy and goal on this
topic for companies and supply chains.
375

o Deforestation-free refers to no gross deforestation of natural forests, which the
Accountability Framework specifies as the appropriate policy and goal on this
topic for companies and supply chains.
o In the context of the Accountability Framework, deforestation refers to the loss of
natural forest (see definition of deforestation).
o The terms “no-conversion”, and “deforestation- and conversion-free” are used in
favor of “zero-conversion” because “zero” can imply an absolutist approach that
may be at odds with the need to sometimes accommodate minimal levels of
conversion at the site level in the interest of facilitating optimal conservation and
production outcomes (see AFi’s definition for minimal level [of deforestation or
conversion], 2024) (adapted from AFi, 2024).
• Deforestation-free (also referred to as: no-deforestation): commodity production, sourcing,
or financial investments that do not cause or contribute to deforestation.
o Deforestation-free refers to no gross deforestation of natural forests, which the
Accountability Framework specifies as the appropriate policy and goal on this
topic for companies and supply chains.
o In the context of the Accountability Framework, deforestation refers to the loss of
natural forest (see definition of deforestation).
o The terms “no-deforestation” and “deforestation-free” are used in favor of “zero
deforestation” because “zero” can imply an absolutist approach that may be at
odds with the need sometimes to accommodate minimal levels of conversion at
the site level in the interest of facilitating optimal conservation and production
outcomes (see AFi’s definition for minimal level [of deforestation or conversion],
2024) (adapted from AFi, 2024).
• Exposure to carbon-related assets: the amount or percentage of carbon-related assets in
the portfolio expressed in Million revenue or percentage of the current portfolio value.
• Carbon-related assets: The TCFD Annex suggests defining carbon-related assets as those
assets tied to the four non-financial groups (1. Energy, 2. Transportation, 3. Materials and
Buildings, and 4. Agriculture, Food, and Forest Products) identified by the TCFD.
• Emissions to water: discharge of solid, liquid or gaseous pollutants or contaminants into a
body of water.
o The Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation (SFDR) defines “emissions to
water” as “direct emissions of priority substances as defined in Article 2(30) of
Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and direct
nitrates, direct phosphate emissions, direct pesticides emissions as referred to
in that Directive, Council Directive of 12 December 1991 concerning the
protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural
source (91/676/EEC), Council Directive 91/271/EEC of 21 May 1991 concerning
urban waste-water treatment, and Directive 2010/75/EU of the European
Parliament and Council.”
• Insurance-associated emissions: absolute insurance-associated emissions (tCO2e) are a
supplementary accounting note to the GHG Protocol Scope 3 Category 15 “Investments”. The
Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) describes insurance associated
emissions here.
• Financed absolute biodiversity footprint (MSA/km2/year) & (PDF/km2/year): impact
metrics suggested by TNFD in the sector specific guidance for financial institutions, see page
34 in “Additional guidance for financial institutions”.
376

• MSA: Mean Species Abundance (MSA) estimates ecosystem condition (i.e. intactness) as a
function of select anthropogenic pressures on terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. It
measures condition in terms of the average abundance of species in selected groups
compared to a natural reference state. For more, refer to TNFD’s “Biodiversity footprinting
approaches for financial institutions” discussion paper.
• Other carbon footprinting and/or exposure metrics: metrics organizations in the
financial sector can use to understand how their financial portfolio impacts the climate, as
identified by the TCFD and to be used alongside portfolio emission metrics.
• PDF: Potentially Disappeared Fraction (PDF) of species is a metric developed for life cycle
impact assessments (LCA) as a measure of local loss of ecosystem condition caused by
specific anthropogenic pressures. While PDF is often considered an ecosystem metric,
some applications of it are actually more closely related to measures of species extinction
risk. For more, refer to TNFD’s “Biodiversity footprinting approaches for financial
institutions” discussion paper.
• Weighted average carbon intensity: portfolio’s exposure to carbon-intensive
companies, expressed in tons CO e/Million revenue. This is the metric recommended by
2
the TCFD.

Explanation of • Portfolio breakdown by asset class: most existing methodologies to quantify portfolio
terms impact are determined and calculated on an asset class level. Breaking down emissions
and other carbon footprinting and/or exposure metrics by asset class can give an
indication of the relative GHG emissions performance and/or exposure to climate-related
risks of your company’s assets. When reported over time, your organization and investors
will be able to review improvements or declines in asset performance with considerations
for your portfolio’s impact on the climate. This breakdown can be used alongside the
financial performance of a company’s assets to understand the financial exposure and
illustrate the scale of contributions to climate change. Because methodologies are more
robust for some asset classes than others, providing this level of data will enable data
users to identify gaps in the methodologies and lead to the expansion of coverage.
• Portfolio breakdown by industry: as sectoral decarbonization is at the center of some
carbon footprinting methodologies, breaking down emissions, other carbon footprinting
and/or exposure metrics on an industry level is key to identify concentrations of carbon-
related assets in the financial sector and the financial system’s exposure to climate-related
risks. Reporting at this level can provide a useful indicator for making comparisons
between your financial activities in different industries. In some cases, particular industries
378

may come within the scope of particular legislation, therefore, providing industry-level
emissions and/or exposure figures may give data users insight into your organization’s
current/potential exposure to regulation in this industry.
• Portfolio breakdown by Scope: current methodologies for calculating portfolio emissions
can lead to double counting across scopes. For example, what are counted as Scope 1
emissions for an electricity generation company could be the same emissions for a retailer
but counted as Scope 2. There is currently no way for financial institutions to overcome
this in their portfolio emission calculations, but this question allows you to report
emissions by scope separately. Breaking down absolute emissions of their portfolio by
scope can help financial institution identify emissions throughout the value chain of
companies in their portfolio. PCAF recommends that emissions associated with loans and
investments should be reported separately by Scope if it serves financial institutions’
business goals (e.g. Scope 1 emissions of investees or Scope 2 emissions of investees).
• Portfolio impact: impact of financial activities, namely lending, investment and insurance
underwriting, on the environment.

Question
This question appears for organizations in the Financial Services sector who report in 1.10 that

Rationale The majority of financial institutions’ emissions are driven by the activities they finance in the
wider economy, also known as ‘financed emissions’. The exposure of financial institutions to
climate-related risks and opportunities are determined by their portfolios via lending, investment
and insurance underwriting activities. Therefore, data users wish to understand the
concentrations of fossil fuel assets in financial institutions’ portfolios.
Ambition Financial institutions measure and disclose their financing and insurance of fossil fuel assets to
understand, and help data users understand, their impact on the climate.

(column 8)
• This column only appears if any “No” option is selected in column 1 “Reporting values of
the financing and/or insurance of fossil fuel assets”.
• Ensure your explanation is organization-specific and provides details as to why you do not
provide a value for the financing and/or insurance to fossil fuel assets.
• For example, if your organization provides strictly retail banking only (no commercial,
institutional or business lending), provide details here.
• If you plan to assess your exposure within the next 2 years provide details of how you plan
to do this.
• If you wish to provide any additional context to your disclosure, including any plans or
timelines your organization has for completely phasing out financing and/or insurance of
fossil fuel assets, you can also do that in this column.
Explanation of • Fossil fuel assets: assets tied to carbon-based fuels from fossil hydrocarbon
terms deposits, including coal, oil, and natural gas.
• Met coal: metallurgical coal, also known as coking coal, is used to produce coke,
the primary source of carbon used in steelmaking. It differs from thermal coal by
its carbon content and its coking ability.
• Thermal coal: coal used for energy and heating.

Rationale The production of certain key agricultural commodities has caused more than 60% of forest loss
in Latin America and Southeast Asia, usually resulting in a permanent loss. While not all
commodity production is necessarily harmful, understanding the concentrations of commodity-
related assets in portfolios will enable financial institutions to understand where there is the
potential for deforestation impacts and where enhanced policies are needed to prevent them.
Ambition Financial services companies measure and disclose their financing and insurance of agricultural
commodities to understand the potential impact on deforestation.

Explanation of • Commodities: The following are asked about in this questionnaire:
terms
o Timber products: all solid timber as well as products made from processed wood
fiber such as paper, packaging, cardboard and specialty fibers (e.g., viscose). It
also includes timber products used for biomass.
o Palm oil: crude palm oil, palm kernel oil, and all of its derivatives. Please note
that palm oil used for biofuel production is also included in this category.
o Cattle products: all food products containing beef, all clothing, furniture and
accessories that are made of leather, tallow, and all other products derived from
cattle. Please note that tallow used for biofuel production is also included in this
category. Dairy products are not included in this category.
o Soy: all meal or oil containing soy and any derivatives that are obtained from soy.
Please note that soy used for biofuel production is also included in this category.
o Rubber: all rubber products deriving from natural rubber production. Please note
that the tire industry is included in this category.
o Cocoa: all food or other products containing cocoa, cocoa derivatives such as
cocoa butter or pectin, or any products derived from cocoa husks such as animal
feed or potash.
o Coffee: all products from or derived from coffee plants, including the beans,
cherries and husks
• Production: the first stage of the upstream value chain, often entailing the production of raw
agricultural and forest products by farm owners, smallholders, and communities. Vertically
integrated companies are also involved in producing activities if they own or manage land used
for production (adapted from Global Canopy, 2018 and AFi, 2024).
• Processing: the series of actions that transform raw materials from their natural state to an
initial processed state in preparation for market or further processing/manufacturing.
o Organizations involved in the production of crude palm oil from crushed fruit or the
production of soybean oil and soybean meal from soybean would select this activity.
Further processing activities in the form of refining and fractionation should be
considered in the manufacturing stage.
o In the case of timber products, organizations whose activities include the initial
processing of timber products in mills (i.e., sawmills, plywood and veneer mills, pulp
and paper mills) would select this stage.
o For cattle products, activities at this stage primarily involve the slaughtering of cattle
and the processing of raw hide into leather.
• Trading: purchasing and selling raw or primary processed agricultural or forestry materials to
domestic or export markets. This includes shipments, transport, and storage of the
commodities.
• Manufacturing: the series of actions, methods, and techniques that transform raw or
processed materials into final products ready for human use/consumption.
o In palm oil and soybean supply chains, this stage may include the refining of oil into
shortening and the use of ingredients in the manufacture of bakery products.
o For timber products, the manufacturing stage involves the secondary processing of
wood into multiple products. This may include furniture, flooring, plywood and boards,
394

as well as other building materials. For pulp and paper, this may include the conversion
of pulp to printing and writing paper, newsprint, tissue, container boards, and
packaging.
o Organizations may manufacture cattle products into products containing beef (e.g.,
retail meat products, fast food, byproducts including glycerin/gelatin) and leather
products for various industries (e.g., footwear, clothing, furniture and car upholstery)
(adapted from Global Canopy, 2018 and AFi, 2024).
• Retailing: selling products directly to individual consumers. This includes supermarkets,
convenience stores, lumber and home improvement stores, home furnishing stores, online
retailers, and restaurant chains.

aligned with a sustainable finance taxonomy”.
• Explain why you are not providing values of the financing and/or insurance of activities or
sectors that are eligible under or aligned with a sustainable finance taxonomy.
Explanation of • Activity enabling climate change adaptation: the activity enables a substantial
terms contribution to be made to climate change adaptation in other activities. For example, the
activity is developing adaptation solutions.
• Activity enabling climate change mitigation: the activity enables a substantial
contribution to be made to climate change mitigation in other activities. For example, the
activity enables other activities to achieve emissions reductions.
• Adapted activity: the activity is being performed in a way that it itself contributes
substantially by making a positive impact or removing a negative impact on climate
change adaptation. For example, where the activity adopts adaptation solutions. If you are
disclosing alignment against the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities, note that
activities may qualify as substantially contributing through own performance if they meet
the corresponding technical screening criteria established by the Climate Delegated Act
(Annex II- pg. 146- 346).
• Capital Expenditure (CAPEX): a measure of the value of purchases of fixed assets such as
property, buildings, an industrial plant, technology, or equipment. Put differently, CAPEX is
any type of expense that a company capitalizes, or shows on its balance sheet as an
investment, rather than on its income statement as an expenditure. In case of reporting to
the EU Taxonomy, please refer the explanation for “Key Performance Indicators” below, for
further information on the exact reporting requirements of the CAPEX KPI.
• Climate change adaptation: the process of adjustment to actual and expected climate
change and its impacts.
406

• Climate change mitigation: the process of holding the increase in the global average
temperature to well below 2°C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5°C above pre-industrial
levels, as laid down in the Paris Agreement.
• “Do No Significant Harm” principle: a taxonomy-eligible activity that substantially
contributes to one or more of the taxonomy’s objectives and complies with international
best practices for sustainable business and social safeguards may only qualify as an
environmentally sustainable (i.e., “taxonomy-aligned”) if it does not cause significant harm
to any other environmental objective. In relation to the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable
Activities, this refers to the conditions specified under Article 17 of the EU Taxonomy
Regulation.
• Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): in relation to the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable
Activities, the KPIs refer to the proportion of the turnover and capital expenditure (CAPEX)
related to assets or processes associated with environmentally sustainable economic
activities. For each of the Turnover KPI, CAPEX KPI, this refers to the numerator divided by
the denominator as specified by the Disclosure Delegated Act (Annex I p17- 19).
• Substantial contribution: a taxonomy-eligible activity is said to substantially contribute to
one or more environmental objectives under a taxonomy when it, through its own
performance, meets the corresponding technical screening criteria set out by the relevant
taxonomy. In relation to the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities this refers to the
technical screening criteria established by the Climate Delegated Act (Annexes I and II).
• Sustainable finance taxonomy: as defined by the Bank for International Settlements, a
sustainable finance taxonomy is a set of criteria which can form the basis for an evaluation
of whether and to what extent a financial asset can support given sustainability goals. The
central goal of taxonomies is driving capital allocation towards sustainable activities,
reducing greenwashing, and enabling simpler comparison.
• Taxonomy-aligned: an activity is considered ‘taxonomy-aligned’ if your organization
generates turnover or invests in capital or operating expenditure corresponding to such
activities, and the activity meets the technical screening criteria and do no significant harm
criteria prescribed by the sustainable finance taxonomy and complies with international
best practices for sustainable business and social safeguards.
• Taxonomy-eligible but not aligned: an activity is considered ‘taxonomy-eligible but not
aligned’ if your organization generates turnover or invests in capital or operating
expenditure corresponding to an activity, but the activity does not meet the technical
screening criteria and/or do no significant harm criteria prescribed by the sustainable
finance taxonomy and/or does not comply with international best practices for sustainable
business and social safeguards.
• Transitional activity: the activity does not have a technologically or economically feasible
low-carbon alternative, but substantially contributes to climate change mitigation by
supporting the transition to a net-zero carbon economy consistent with a pathway to limit
the temperature increase to 1.5C above preindustrial levels.
• Turnover: “net turnover” means the amounts derived from the sale of products and the
provision of services after deducting sales rebates and value added tax and other taxes
directly linked to turnover, as per Article 2(5) of Directive 2013/34/EU (The Accounting
Directive). In case of reporting to the EU Taxonomy, please refer the explanation for “Key
Performance Indicators” below, for further information on the exact reporting requirements
of the Turnover KPI.

Explanation of • Adaptation: adjustment to climate change current or expected effects so the
terms consequences to the business and environment are alleviated and beneficial
opportunities are realized.
• Carbon removals: solutions which remove CO from the atmosphere and permanently
2
store it.
• Ecosystem protection: activities aimed at protecting the integrity of existing ecosystems.
• Ecosystem restoration: the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has
been degraded, damaged, or destroyed.
• Emerging climate technology (ECT): a commercially promising technology that addresses
climate mitigation challenges but needs to attract enough investment to deploy the
technology and develop business models and markets for the product or services it
produces. Eventually it may become a successful innovation deployed at scale, generating
new markets or profoundly disrupting established (fossil-based) ones (Auerswald et al.,
2005). For a more detailed definition and guidance, refer to the ECT initiative.
• Energy efficiency measures: solutions which require less energy, e.g. energy efficient
measures in buildings or the production process. Energy efficient solutions can help to
mitigate against CO2 and is key in achieving net zero emissions by 2050.
• Flood/drought resilience: solutions which can reduce the impact of a flood or
drought. Resilience can be built in a variety of ways, such as improving urban drainage
systems, securing multiple/diverse water sources, or building monitoring capabilities.
• Fortified buildings: fortified buildings use retrofit techniques to strengthen new and
existing homes, making them more resistant to storms and other severe weather events.
414

• Green buildings and equipment: buildings and equipment that are energy efficient or
otherwise sustainable. Mature technologies identified by the IEA found under “Buildings” in
the ETP Clean Energy Technology Guide.
• Landscape and jurisdictional approach: a muti-stakeholder collaborative strategy to
advance shared sustainability goals and build resilience at landscape scale. A jurisdictional
approach is a landscape approach defined by administrative boundaries and with high level
of government involvement.
• Low-emission transport: transport modes (road, rail, shipping and aviation) which results
in lower emissions, e.g. electric vehicles or increased transport efficiency. Mature
technologies identified by the IEA found under “Transport” in the ETP Clean Energy
Technology Guide.
• Mitigation: actions that limit the magnitude or rate of climate change, deforestation
and/or water security.
• Nature-based Solutions: actions to protect, conserve, restore, sustainably use and
manage natural or modified terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems, which
address social, economic and environmental challenges effectively and adaptively, while
simultaneously providing human well-being, ecosystem services and resilience and
biodiversity benefits. (UNEA-5)
• Paperless/digital service: Providing services to customer via digital/online services as
oppose to paper/posted services, e.g. online billing statements.
• Reforestation: re-establishment of forest through planting and/or deliberate seeding on
land classified as forest (FAO, 2015).
• Regenerative Production: a range of approaches used to manage agroecosystems that
provide food and materials – be it through agriculture, aquaculture or forestry etc. — in ways
that create positive outcomes for nature. These outcomes include, but are not limited to,
healthy soils, improved air and water quality, and higher levels of carbon sequestration. They
can be achieved through a variety of context-dependent practices and can together help
regenerate degraded ecosystems and build resilience on farms and in surrounding
landscapes. Farmers may draw on several different schools of thought, such as regenerative
agriculture, restorative aquaculture, agroecology, organic, permaculture, agroforestry, and
conservation agriculture, to help them apply the most appropriate set of practices to drive
regenerative outcomes in their managed agroecosystems (Adapted from EMF).
• Renewable energy: energy taken from sources that are inexhaustible, e.g. wind, water,
solar, geothermal energy and sustainable biofuels (adapted from the GHG protocol, 2004).
• Risk transfer mechanisms for under-insured or uninsured: innovative risk transfer
mechanisms or insurance products, e.g. risk pools or catastrophe bonds, which help under-
insured or uninsured communities to meet the challenges of a changing climate.
• Sustainable agriculture: farming that is environmentally sound, socially responsible,
and profitable for farmers. Sustainable agriculture strives for the best long-term
outcomes for forests, climate stability, and water security.
• Sustainable forest management: the process of managing a forest for achieving the
continuous production of desired forest products and services without reducing its
inherent values and future productivity, avoiding undesirable social-environmental effects.
• WASH services: water, sanitation, and hygiene services.
• Wastewater treatment infrastructure: important infrastructure for the removal of
hazardous, toxic and otherwise harmful substances from wastewater prior to its discharge
to the environment.
• Water resources and ecosystem protection: practices including watershed
remediation, habitat restoration, and ecosystem preservation.
415

• Water supply and sewer networks infrastructure: infrastructure that improves water
access and the treatment of wastewater prior to its discharge to the environment.
Improvements to water supply and sewer networks can reduce pipe leakage and water
losses, improve the quality of water delivered to users, and reduce sewer overflows which
lead to water pollution.
• Water treatment infrastructure: infrastructure that allows water to be treated to a
drinking standard or another appropriate treatment level for use. E.g. Desalination
infrastructure.

Rationale This information gives data users confidence in the quality and credibility of your
organization’s response. CDP supports third-party verification and assurance as good
practice in environmental reporting as it ensures the reliability of the data and processes
disclosed. This question allows leading organizations to report their efforts on this and to
highlight trends in verification and assurance of interest to investors and purchasing
organizations. CDP also recognizes the growing importance to organizations of disclosing
credible independently verified environmental data for demonstrating compliance with
emerging standards and regulations.

Requested Disclosure module and data verified and/or assured (column 2)
content • Select the questionnaire module in which the verified/assured data is reported.
• For each module selected, indicate the data points from your CDP response that have been
verified/assured by a third party.
• If the verified/assured data points are not listed, select “Other data point in …, please specify”
and provide the relevant data point.
Verification standard (column 3)
• This column requests the verification standard against which the verification/assurance
process has been undertaken. It does not refer to the reporting or calculation standard.
• The options provided are not a comprehensive list of all acceptable environmental-related
verification/assurance standards. Inclusion here does not mean that CDP has made a
judgement about the standards or is promoting the use of any particular standard above
another.
• Refer to the following criteria when considering if a verification standard is credible:
o Relevance: The standard should specify that it relates to a third-party audit or
verification process; for a program-related standard, third-party verification should
be specified as part of the program compliance.
o Competency: The standard should include a statement regarding the competency of
verifiers; where it is a program and verification parties are stipulated, competency is
assumed to be determined by the second party and therefore need not be explicit in
the standard.
o Independence: The standard should contain a requirement that ensures that
impartiality is maintained in cases where the same external organization compiles
and verifies a responding organization’s inventory.
o Terminology: The standard should specify the meaning of any terms used for the
level of the finding (e.g. limited assurance; reasonable assurance).
o Methodology: The standard should describe a methodology for the verification that
includes the verification of the process and/or system controls and the data.
o Availability: The standard should be available for scrutiny.
Further details of the third-party verification/assurance process (column 4)
• You may use this column to provide additional details about the verification/assurance
process such as:
o How often the verification/assurance is performed;
o The scope it encompasses (i.e., whether it applies to your direct operations only,
to your upstream/downstream value chain; or only to selected regions, facilities,
and products);
o The rationale for the chosen data points, and standard;
o The level of insurance the verification provides (i.e., Limited assurance,
Moderate assurance, Reasonable assurance, or High assurance); and
o Any parts of the data point selected in column 2 that are excluded from the
verification process, and why.
430

• If you are reporting verification/assurance of target-related details, provide any relevant
target reference numbers.
Attach verification/assurance evidence/report (optional) (column 5)
• You may attach a copy of your verifier’s report or equivalent document here. This is optional
but will support the robustness of your disclosure.
Requested Note for financial services companies:
content – [sector] • Disclose the verification of data in module 12: Environmental performance – Financial
(if applicable) services, other than data disclosed in 12.1.1 and/or 12.1.3.
• The verification of financed emissions as per 12.1.1 and/or 12.1.3 should be disclosed in
7.9.3.
Additional • For further details on good practice for verification and assurance refer to CDP’s guide on
information the business benefits of third-party verification of environmental data.
• There is no requirement for data to be verified twice, as such data that has already been
verified for one scheme/reporting effort can normally be used for another. Check the
specifications of your verification body/evidence to ensure this is the case.
