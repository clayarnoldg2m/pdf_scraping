It includes all the questions from\nthe CDP corporate question bank, across all environmental issues, for all requesting authorities, and all sector-specific\nquestions and guidance.\nPlease note that each discloser\u2019s route through the questionnaire is tailored according to their sector, the environmental\nissues they are disclosing on, and the organizations that have requested them to disclose. Therefore, not all questions in this\ndocument will be relevant for your organization.\nWhen using our online portal, the questionnaire will be customized specifically for your organization, using the information\nyou provide in the questionnaire setup process. Your responses to the questions may unlock further questions or modules\nin the questionnaire.\nSee our Introduction to the CDP Corporate Questionnaires and our Knowledge Base to find out more about the CDP\nquestionnaires and our approach to disclosure.\nBelow each question in this document there is a \u2018Tags\u2019 section, which shows which disclosers will see the question. This is\nbased on the organizations that have requested them to disclose and the information provided during their questionnaire\nsetup:\n1. Authority Type: who has requested the organization to disclose. For example, if a question is only shown to\norganizations who have been requested to disclose by a CDP Supply Chain member, this row of the table will say\n\u201cSupply chain\u201d. Questions with \u201cAll requesters\u201d in this field will be shown to all disclosers.\n2. Environmental Issue: which environmental issues does the question relate to. For example, if a question is only\nshown to organizations disclosing on forests, this row of the table will say \u201cF only\u201d.\n3. Questionnaire Sector: details of any sector-specific content, based on CDP ACS classification. For example, if a\nquestion is only shown to financial services sector organizations, this row of the table will say \u201cFS only\u201d.\nIn the example below, the \u201cTags\u201d table indicates that the question will be shown to organizations who are responding to a\nrequest from a CDP Supply Chain member, are disclosing on water security, and have any CDP ACS sector other than\nfinancial services.\nTags\nAuthority Type Supply chain\nEnvironmental Issue (Theme) Question level W only\nQuestionnaire Sector Question level All (except FS)\n2\n\nContents\nContents ............................................................................................................................................................................................................... 3\nModule 8: Environmental Performance \u2013 Forests ............................................................................................................................................ 10\nExclusions .......................................................................................................................................................................................................... 11",

This covers any internal value chains between the organization\u2019s business units\n(adapted from TNFD, 2023; SBTN, 2023).\n\u2022 Facilities: may be used throughout this questionnaire as a broad term and not restricted to a\nparticular site or grouping of fixed buildings and factories. For example, if your organization is\nin the extractive industries, you might normally collate business information for assets or\nbusiness units, and so you may wish to define \u2018facility\u2019 information in this way.\n\u2022 Total commodity volume: the total volume of a commodity produced and/or sourced\n(including used, purchased, and consumed) by your organization regardless of whether this\nvolume is included or excluded from your disclosure.\n\u2022 Upstream value chain (also referred to as \u2018supply chain\u2019): the activities, sites, resources,\nrelationships, and stakeholders that provide products and/or services to your organization.\nThis typically involves activities early in the value chain, such as production or development.\nThe upstream value chain varies depending on the nature of the business but may include raw\nmaterial, component, or equipment suppliers (adapted from ESRS, 2023).\nAdditional The GHG Protocol states that an acknowledgement of all exclusions should be made each year to\ninformation enhance transparency despite disclosure of the same exclusion in previous years.

If you only produce or directly source soy or soy products e.g., animal feed containing\nsoy, then this should be reported as \u201cDirect soy only\u201d in column 3 of 1.22.\n\u2022 Note: soy derivatives should be reported as \u201cdirect soy\u201d and not as \u201cembedded soy\u201d in 1.22.\nRefer to the \u201cExplanation of terms\u201d section below to identify the distinction between the\ndifference in terms \u201cEmbedded soy\u201d, \u201cDirect soy\u201d, and \u201cDerivative\u201d.\n\u2022 If you have included embedded soy within your \"Sourced volume\u201d (i.e., your \u201cDisclosure\nvolume\u201d) in 8.2, this question will gather further information on your embedded soy to visualise\nhow embedded soy affects the rest of your disclosure and the progress made on these\nvolumes.\nDisclosure of embedded soy (column 1)\n\u2022 Selections in this column will determine the presentation of further columns in this table.\n\u2022 If you select \u201cSome or all of our embedded soy volume is included in our \u201cSourced volume\u201d as\nreported in column 4 of 8.2\" you will be asked to provide further information of your embedded\nsoy volume in this table.\n\u2022 If you select \u201cAll of our embedded soy volume is excluded from our disclosure as reported in\n8.1.1\u201d, your total embedded soy volume should be reported in 8.1.1 as an exclusion. In this\ncase, you will not be presented with columns 3 \u201cVolume calculation methodology\u201d to 12\n\u201cMethodology used to determine DF/DCF status\u201d.\nDescription of embedded soy use and soy tiers (column 2)\n\u2022 Provide information on the animal products you source and how the soy is embedded within\nthese products, e.g., \u201cWe source products that come from cattle which have been fed soy-\nbased meal.\u201d\n\u2022 The Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) \u201cSoy Measurement Ladder\u201d groups products into five tiers.\nEach tier contains groupings of similar products for which soy usage occurs at the same point\nin the value chain. Tiers 2 to 5 include product groupings that are applicable to embedded soy\nusers. Use this resource to identify how the animal products you source fall into the different\ntiers.\n\u2022 If possible, provide the different proportions of your embedded soy volume categorized across\nthe different tiers e.g., \u201c40% of our embedded soy volume falls into Tier 2 (meat, e.g., beef) and\nthe remainder 60% falls into Tier 3 (eggs and dairy).\u201d\n\u2022 Indicate whether certain tiers are excluded from your disclosure.\n20\n\nVolume calculation methodology (column 3)\n\u2022 Provide details on the methodology used to calculate your embedded soy volume, including\nany references to literature on the conversion factor used or specialist tools such as the RTRS\nSoy Footprint Calculator.\n\u2022 If you are reporting on multiple products that are in different product tiers, where possible,\nclarify the methodology used for each tier.\n\u2022 If you have not calculated your entire embedded soy volume, provide a brief explanation as to\nwhy you are not able to calculate the entire scope of your embedded soy volume.\nEmbedded soy disclosure volume (metric tons) (column 4)\n\u2022 State the volume of embedded soy that you source, in metric tons, which is included in your\n\u201cSourced volume\u201d in column 4 of 8.2.\n\u2022 This is the volume that will be included in your \u201cDisclosure volume\u201d and \u201cSourced volume\u201d\nthroughout the environmental performance forests module.\n\u2022 Do not include any of the embedded soy volume that you have excluded in 8.1.1.\n% of sourced volume that is embedded soy (column 5)\n\u2022 Calculate the percentage of your soy \u201cSourced volume\u201d reported in column 4 of 8.2, that is your\n\u201cEmbedded soy disclosure volume\u201d reported in column 4 of this question.\nDescription of traceability system (column 7)\n\u2022 This column only appears if \u201cYes, we have a traceability system for our embedded soy\u201d is\nselected in column 6 \u201cTraceability system\u201d.\n\u2022 Report on the level of traceability of your embedded soy. This includes whether you can trace\nto:\no the soy production origin; or\no the soy feed supplier origin; or\no to the origin of the animal that was fed the soy.\n\u2022 If you have traced back to the soy production origin, indicate if this is to country/area level,\nsourcing area or production unit.\n\u2022 In addition, provide details of the methods and tools used to trace your embedded soy.\n% of embedded soy disclosure volume traceable to country/area of soy production (column 8)\n\u2022 This column only appears if \u201cYes, we have a traceability system for our embedded soy\u201d is\nselected in column 6 \u201cTraceability system\u201d.\n\u2022 State the percentage of your embedded soy disclosure volume that is traceable back to the\ncountry/area of soy production. For guidance on country/area lists, refer to the CDP technical\nnote: Countries, Areas and Regions.\n% of embedded soy disclosure volume for which the soy production origin is unknown (column 9)\n\u2022 This column only appears if \u201cYes, we have a traceability system for our embedded soy\u201d is\nselected in column 6 \u201cTraceability system\u201d.\n\u2022 State the percentage of your embedded soy disclosure volume for which you cannot trace back\nto the country/area of soy production. This should also include the volume for which you can\nonly trace back to the country of animal production or to the soy feed supplier, as this is not\nnecessarily the country of where the soy was produced and harvested.\n\u2022 Note: ensure the sum of figures provided here and in column 8 \u201c% of embedded soy\ndisclosure volume traceable to country/area of soy production\u201d is 100%.\n21\n\nDF/DCF status assessed for embedded soy (column 10) - Methodology used to determine DF/DCF status\n(column 12)\n\u2022 Columns 10-12 request information about the DF or DCF status of your \u201cEmbedded soy\ndisclosure volume\u201d reported in column 4. The DF/DCF designation signifies that materials did\nnot originate from production units where conversion from forests or other natural ecosystems\noccurred after a specified cutoff date.\n\u2022 If you have assessed your DF/DCF status, you will be asked to report the proportion of your\nembedded soy disclosure volume that is determined as DF/DCF and the methods you have\nused to determine those volumes as DF/DCF.\n\u2022 The DF/DCF status may be assessed via any of these three methods:\no Certification through schemes providing full DF/DCF assurance\no Production unit level monitoring\no Sourcing area level monitoring\n\u2022 For volumes reported here to be considered DF/DCF, you must also report a cutoff date in\n8.7.1. Cutoff dates provide the basis for calculating your DF/DCF volumes. For example, if you\nreport a 2020 cutoff date for a soy no-conversion target in 8.7.1, the percentage of your\nembedded soy disclosure volume reported as DCF in column 11 must originate from\nproduction units free from deforestation and conversion since 2020.\n\u2022 Select \u201cYes, deforestation-free (DF) status assessed\u201d in column 10 \u201cDF/DCF status assessed\nfor embedded soy\u201d if your organization has assessed whether embedded soy volumes have\ncontributed to deforestation since a specified cutoff date, and you have a no-deforestation or a\nno-conversion target that will be reported on in 8.7.1.\n\u2022 Select \u201cYes, deforestation- and conversion-free (DCF) status assessed\u201d in column 10 \u201cDF/DCF\nstatus assessed for embedded soy\u201d if your assessment includes conversion of other natural\necosystems since a specified cutoff date, and you have a no-conversion target that will be\nreported on in 8.7.1.\n\u2022 For information on DCF accounting and the methods to determine DCF, consult the following\nresources:\no the joint AFi, GHG protocol and SBTi FLAG guidance (2023); and,\no the Proforest (2022) Generic Verified Deforestation and Conversion Free (V-DCF)\nmethodology.\nExplanation of \u2022 Cutoff date: the date after which deforestation or conversion renders a given area or\nterms production unit non-compliant with no-deforestation or no-conversion, commitments, policies,\ngoals, targets, or other obligations (AFi, 2024).\n\u2022 Deforestation-free (also referred to as \u201cno-deforestation\u201d): commodity production, sourcing,\nor financial investments that do not cause or contribute to deforestation.\no Deforestation-free refers to no gross deforestation of natural forests, which the\nAccountability Framework specifies as the appropriate policy and goal on this\ntopic for companies and supply chains.\no In the context of the Accountability Framework, deforestation refers to the loss of\nnatural forest (see definition of deforestation).\no The terms \u201cno-deforestation\u201d and \u201cdeforestation-free\u201d are used in favor of \u201czero\ndeforestation\u201d because \u201czero\u201d can imply an absolutist approach that may be at\nodds with the need sometimes to accommodate minimal levels of conversion at\nthe site level in the interest of facilitating optimal conservation and production\noutcomes (see AFi\u2019s definition for minimal level [of deforestation or conversion],\n2024) (adapted from AFi, 2024).\n22\n\n\u2022 Deforestation- and conversion-free (also referred to as \"no-conversion\"): commodity\nproduction, sourcing, or financial investments that do not cause or contribute to deforestation\nand the conversion of natural ecosystems.\no Conversion-free refers to no gross conversion of natural ecosystems, which the\nAccountability Framework specifies as the appropriate policy and goal on this\ntopic for companies and supply chains.\no Deforestation-free refers to no gross deforestation of natural forests, which the\nAccountability Framework specifies as the appropriate policy and goal on this\ntopic for companies and supply chains.\no In the context of the Accountability Framework, deforestation refers to the loss of\nnatural forest (see definition of deforestation).\no The terms \u201cno-conversion\u201d, and \u201cdeforestation- and conversion-free\u201d are used in\nfavor of \u201czero-conversion\u201d because \u201czero\u201d can imply an absolutist approach that\nmay be at odds with the need to sometimes accommodate minimal levels of\nconversion at the site level in the interest of facilitating optimal conservation and\nproduction outcomes (see AFi\u2019s definition for minimal level [of deforestation or\nconversion], 2024) (adapted from AFi, 2024).\n\u2022 Derivative: a purposely extracted or derived substance from a commodity.

        {
          "question": "Why is it important for organizations to report on embedded soy?",
          "answer": "Global population growth is increasing the demand for animal products and consequently, increasing the demand for soy used to feed animals. This growth in soy production is linked to deforestation and conversion of natural ecosystems and usually goes unaccounted for, as it is 'embedded' or 'hidden' in organizations' value chains."
        },
        {
          "question": "How should organizations calculate their embedded soy volume?",
          "answer": "Organizations should provide details on the methodology used to calculate their embedded soy volume, including any references to literature on the conversion factor used or specialist tools such as the RTRS Soy Footprint Calculator. If reporting on multiple products that are in different product tiers, clarify the methodology used for each tier."

          "answer": "The DF/DCF status may be assessed via certification through schemes providing full DF/DCF assurance, production unit level monitoring, or sourcing area level monitoring. For volumes reported as DF/DCF, a cutoff date must be reported in 8.7.1, which provides the basis for calculating DF/DCF volumes."

Ensure the numeric type for these figures is consistent throughout each target.\nFor example, if you are using a percentage for the column 11 \u201cBase year figure\u201d you should\nalso provide a percentage in the column 13 \u201cTarget year figure\u201d and column 14 \u201cReporting year\nfigure\u201d.\n\u2022 If you choose to report on your base, target and reporting year figures using a percentage, the\npercentage for each should be equal to the amount of the selected metric during the\nbase/target/reporting year divided by the total amount of that specific metric. For example, if\nyour organization has a total of 50 direct suppliers and engaged with 20 of them during the\nbase year, then your base year figure should be 40%. Similarly, if your organization engaged\nwith 30 direct suppliers during the reporting year, then your reporting year figure should be\n60%.\nTarget reference number (column 2)\n\u2022 Select a \u201cTarget reference number\u201d from the drop-down list to allocate a unique identifier to\nyour target. This will allow you to track and report progress for this target in future disclosures\nto CDP until the target is retired. The target reference number is not specific to your\norganization.\n\u2022 When providing information from previously disclosed targets, be sure to use the same\nreference number as in previous years. Targets should keep their reference number in\nsubsequent years. A target reference number may only apply to one single row.\nTarget contributes to no-deforestation or no-conversion target reported in 8.7 (column 3)\n\u2022 This column only appears if you have selected \u201cYes, we have a no-deforestation target\u201d or\n\u201cYes, we have a no-conversion target\u201d in response to column 1 \u201cActive no-deforestation or no-\nconversion target\u201d in question 8.7.\n\u2022 If the target you are disclosing on is in place to help your organization achieve its no-\ndeforestation or no-conversion target, indicate this here. For example, a target to improve the\ntraceability of a commodity within its supply chain could be in place to provide insight into\nwhere conversion may be occurring, which can help to enforce preventative measures.\n\u2022 If the target you are disclosing on is not in place to help your organization achieve its no-\ndeforestation or no-conversion target, indicate this here. For example, a target relating to\nhectares of land area invested in under jurisdictional/landscape approach may refer solely to\nland area that does not fall within commodity supply chains, and so would have no influence\non achieving no deforestation or no conversion within them.\nTarget coverage (column 4)\n56\n\n\u2022 Select \u201cOrganization-wide (direct operations only)\u201d, if a target applies to your entire reporting\nboundary, but is limited to your direct operations. Note that \u201cOrganization-wide\u201d refers\ncollectively to all the companies, businesses, organizations, other entities or groups that fall\nwithin your definition of the reporting boundary.\n\u2022 If a target applies to both your direct operations and upstream value chain, select\n\u201cOrganization-wide (including suppliers)\".\n\u2022 If the target does not apply to the whole organization, select the option that best describes the\ncoverage of the target.\no Select \u201cProduct level\u201d if your target applies to specific products produced using the\ndisclosed commodity. For example, if you use cattle products for multiple products,\nbut are disclosing a target to achieve 100% third-party certification for car interior\nspecifically.\n\u2022 If none of the available options describe your target coverage, select \u201cOther, please specify\u201d\nand a text box will appear for you to complete.\nCommodity volume covered by target (metric tons) (column 5)\n\u2022 Select \u201cDisclosure volume\u201d if you selected either \u201cOrganization-wide\u201d option in response to\ncolumn 4 \u201cTarget coverage\u201d, and the target covers your disclosure volume disclosed in column\n1 \u201cDisclosure volume (metric tons)\u201d of 8.2.\n\u2022 Select \u201cTotal commodity volume\u201d if you selected either \u201cOrganization-wide\u201d option in response\nto column 4 \u201cTarget coverage\u201d, and the target covers your entire commodity volume disclosed\nin column 5 \u201cTotal commodity volume (metric tons)\u201d of 1.22.\n\u2022 Select \u201cTotal commodity volume associated with operations or locations covered by target\u201d if\nyou selected any option except either \u201cOrganization-wide\u201d option in response to column 4\n\u201cTarget coverage\u201d, and the target covers the entire volume associated with your selected\ntarget coverage.\n\u2022 If none of the available options reflect the commodity volume covered by the target, select\n\u201cOther volume, please specify\u201d and disclose the commodity volume the target applies to in\nmetric tons.\nCategory of target & quantitative metric (column 6)\n\u2022 Note that some target categories listed in this column correspond to questions you will find in\ndifferent sections of the Environmental Performance - Forests module (Module 8). For greater\nclarity on terminology and different actions to achieve specific targets, refer to the guidance to\nthese individual questions.\n\u2022 If your target is related to \u201cTraceability\u201d, provide further details on the level of traceability\nacross your value chain in column 7 \u201cTraceability point\u201d.\n\u2022 If your target is linked to \u201cThird-party certification\u201d, provide further details on which schemes\nare accepted in column 8 \u201cThird-party certification scheme\u201d.\n\u2022 If disclosing on a \u201c% of volume\u201d metric, the percentage should be of the volume figure\nindicated in column 5 \u201cCommodity volume covered by target (metric tons)\u201d.\n\u2022 If disclosing on a metric that is framed as a percentage reduction, you will need to reframe the\nmetric in columns 11 \u201cBase year figure\u201d, 13 \u201cTarget year figure\u201d and 14 \u201cReporting year figure\u201d\nso that is presented as a percentage increase. This applies to the following metrics:\no % decrease in absolute agricultural land footprint from direct operations\no % decrease in agricultural land footprint intensity from direct operations\no % of commodity volume discarded as waste\no % decrease in average weight of packaging per product unit (grams)\no % decrease in material inputs for paper and packaging products (%)\n57\n\n\u2022 For example, when disclosing using the metric \u201c% of commodity volume discarded as waste\u201d\n\u2013 if 40% of a commodity volume is being discarded as waste, and the target is to bring this\ndown to 0%, this would be presented as 60% of the commodity volume is currently not\ndiscarded as waste in column 11, and the target would be to achieve 100% not discarded as\nwaste in column 13.\nThird-party certification scheme (column 8)\n\u2022 This column only appears if you selected \u201cThird-party certification\u201d in response to column 6\n\u201cCategory of target\u201d.\n\u2022 If you have a target that involves more than one certification scheme per commodity,\nselect all that apply.\n\u2022 If none of the available options describe the scheme adopted by your organization, or if you\nwould like to add a scheme that is not on the list, select \u201cOther, please specify\u201d and a text\nbox will appear for you to complete.\nDate target was set (column 9)\n\u2022 Enter the date in which your organization set the target.\n\u2022 This must be either before or during the reporting year but cannot be after the reporting\nyear or after the end date of target year.\n\u2022 If you have a year-on-year rolling target or a maintenance target, enter the year you first set\nthe target. This can be before the base year.\n\u2022 If you set the target based on financial years, enter the year that applies to the end of your\nfinancial year.\n\u2022 If you do not know the exact date on which your company set the target, enter the end of\nthe year that the target was set.\nEnd date of base year (column 10)\n\u2022 The base year is the year against which you are comparing your target. For example, if the\ntarget is to increase tier 1 supplier engagement by 20% based on the percentage of\nsuppliers engaged in 2020, the end date of the base year is 31st December 2020.\n\u2022 The base year cannot be after your reporting year.\n\u2022 If you have a year-on-year rolling target or a maintenance target, the base year will be the\nprevious reporting year.\n\u2022 If you set the target based on financial years, enter the year that applies to the end of your\nfinancial year.\n\u2022 If you have a target based on an average over a period of time (e.g., 5-year average), enter\nthe year that applies to the end of the average period.\nBase year figure (column 11)\n\u2022 Provide the base year figure for your target. This is the figure against which progress is\nmeasured. It may be an absolute value or a percentage value.\n\u2022 This figure will be used to auto-calculate the \u201c% of target achieved relative to base year\u201d in\ncolumn 16.\nEnd date of target (column 12)\n\u2022 This date represents when you expect to achieve your target.\n58\n\n\u2022 Enter the date year that the target ends. For example, if the target is to increase tier 1\nsupplier engagement by 20% by the end of 2025, the end date of the target is 31st\nDecember 2025.\n\u2022 If you have a year-on-year rolling target or maintenance target, the target year will be the\nreporting year.\n\u2022 If you have a target based on financial years, enter the end date of the year that applies to\nthe end of your financial year.\n\u2022 You should not report any target that was completed before the start of the reporting year.\nTarget year figure (column 13)\n\u2022 Enter the figure that you are aiming to achieve in the target year. This may be a numeric\nvalue or a percentage.\n\u2022 This should not represent the metric\u2019s percent increase, but the targeted figure for the\nmetric in the unit used to monitor it.\n\u2022 If you are disclosing on a maintenance target, this should be the same as your base year\nfigure.\n\u2022 This figure will be used to auto-calculate the \u201c% of target achieved relative to base year\u201d in\ncolumn 16.\nReporting year figure (column 14)\n\u2022 Enter the figure achieved in the reporting year. This may be a numeric value or a\npercentage.\n\u2022 Ensure the figure reported is consistent with your response to column 5 \u201cCommodity\nvolume covered by target (metric tons)\u201d.\n\u2022 This figure will be used to auto-calculate the \u201c% of target achieved relative to base year\u201d in\ncolumn 16.\nTarget status in reporting year (column 15)\n\u2022 New - Select this option for targets that have been set in the reporting year and are still in\nprogress.\n\u2022 Underway - Select this option for targets that were set before the reporting year, with an\nend date in the future, that have not been achieved and continue to be pursued.\n\u2022 Achieved - Select this option for targets that are in place to achieve a certain level of\nperformance (e.g., to achieve 100% compliance with a commitment to no conversion for\nthe volume sourced from direct suppliers) and have been achieved or exceeded in the\nreporting year.\n\u2022 Achieved and maintained \u2013 Select this option for targets that are in place to maintain a\ncertain level of performance (e.g., to maintain 100% compliance with a commitment to no\nconversion for the volume sourced from Tier 1 suppliers) and this has been achieved in the\nreporting year.\n\u2022 Expired - Select this option for targets with an end date within the reporting year, that have\nnot been achieved or maintained and have therefore expired in the reporting year.\n\u2022 Revised - Select this option for targets that were set before the reporting year but a\nrevision has been made to any of the elements in columns 4 to 14 in the reporting year, for\nexample due to a recalculation of the base year figure or a change to the end date of the\ntarget.\n59\n\n\u2022 Replaced - Select this option for previously reported targets that have been replaced with\nanother target in the reporting year, for example where a facility target has been\nincorporated into an organization-wide target.\n\u2022 Retired - Select this option for targets with an end date in the future, that have not been\nachieved, but will no longer be pursued.\n% of target achieved relative to base year [auto-calculated] (column 16)\n\u2022 This column only appears if you have selected any option except \u201cAchieved and\nmaintained\u201d in response to column 15 \u201cTarget status in reporting year\u201d.\n\u2022 This column will be auto-calculated.\n\u2022 The % of target achieved relative to the base year will be calculated using the base year\nfigure (column 11), the target year figure (column 13) and the reporting year figure (column\n14).

establishment of forest through planting and/or deliberate seeding on land\nterms that, until then, was not classified as forest, which implies a transformation of land use\nfrom non-forest to forest (FAO, 2015).\n\u2022 Certification: the action or process of providing a product with an official document\nattesting to a status or level of achievement against a certain standard.\n\u2022 Deforestation-free (also referred to as \u201cno-deforestation\u201d): commodity production,\nsourcing, or financial investments that do not cause or contribute to deforestation.\no Deforestation-free refers to no gross deforestation of natural forests, which the\nAccountability Framework specifies as the appropriate policy and goal on this\ntopic for companies and supply chains.\no In the context of the Accountability Framework, deforestation refers to the loss of\nnatural forest (see definition of deforestation).\no The terms \u201cno-deforestation\u201d and \u201cdeforestation-free\u201d are used in favor of \u201czero\ndeforestation\u201d because \u201czero\u201d can imply an absolutist approach that may be at\nodds with the need sometimes to accommodate minimal levels of conversion at\n61\n\nthe site level in the interest of facilitating optimal conservation and production\noutcomes (see AFi\u2019s definition for minimal level [of deforestation or conversion],\n2024) (adapted from AFi, 2024).\n\u2022 Deforestation- and conversion-free (also referred to as \"no-conversion\"): commodity\nproduction, sourcing, or financial investments that do not cause or contribute to\ndeforestation and the conversion of natural ecosystems.\no Conversion-free refers to no gross conversion of natural ecosystems, which the\nAccountability Framework specifies as the appropriate policy and goal on this\ntopic for companies and supply chains.\no Deforestation-free refers to no gross deforestation of natural forests, which the\nAccountability Framework specifies as the appropriate policy and goal on this\ntopic for companies and supply chains.\no In the context of the Accountability Framework, deforestation refers to the loss of\nnatural forest (see definition of deforestation).\no The terms \u201cno-conversion\u201d, and \u201cdeforestation- and conversion-free\u201d are used in\nfavor of \u201czero-conversion\u201d because \u201czero\u201d can imply an absolutist approach that\nmay be at odds with the need to sometimes accommodate minimal levels of\nconversion at the site level in the interest of facilitating optimal conservation and\nproduction outcomes (see AFi\u2019s definition for minimal level [of deforestation or\nconversion], 2024) (adapted from AFi, 2024).\n\u2022 Landscape and jurisdictional approach: a muti-stakeholder collaborative strategy to\nadvance shared sustainability goals and build resilience at landscape scale. A jurisdictional\napproach is a landscape approach defined by administrative boundaries and with high level\nof government involvement.\n\u2022 Landscape and jurisdictional initiatives: the on-the-ground collaborative program to set\ncommon goals, take collective action while reconciling different interest, and monitor\nprogress towards improving social, environmental, and economic outcomes at\nlandscape/jurisdictional scale.\n\u2022 Reforestation: re-establishment of forest through planting and/or deliberate seeding on\nland classified as forest (FAO, 2015).\n\u2022 Restoration: the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem, and its associated\nconservation values, that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed (adapted from SER,\n2004).\n\u2022 Smallholder: small-scale agricultural or forest products producers that are distinct from\nlarger-scale producers found in similar contexts by virtue of many or all of the following\ncharacteristics:\no high degree of dependence on family labor.\no profits accrue primarily to the farm/forest owner and their family.\no the farm/forest provides a primary source of income livelihood for the smallholder.\no production units have a relatively small land footprint (relative to the range of production\nunit sizes for the given commodity and region).\no household resources are allocated to both food crops and cash crops.\no relatively low use of agricultural inputs and generally low productivity and yields.\no significant economic constraints, such as lack of capital assets and low access to\nfinance.\no significant information constraints, including lack of technical knowledge and low\naccess to market information (adapted from AFi, 2024).\n\u2022 Third-party certification: when a certification process is carried out by an independent\norganization.\n\u2022 Tier 1 supplier (also referred to as \u2018direct supplier\u2019): a supplier that provides or sells\nproducts directly to the reporting organization (GHG Protocol, 2013).\n62\n\n\u2022 Tier 2, 3, or 4+ supplier: a supplier that provides or sells products to the suppliers of the\nreporting organization (GHG Protocol, 2013).\n\u2022 Traceability: the ability to follow a product or its components through stages of the\nupstream value chain (e.g., production, processing, manufacturing, and distribution)\n(adapted from AFi, 2024).\n\u2022 Year-on-year rolling target: targets with a set goal to achieve on a yearly basis.

ii) conversion to a tree plantation; or iii) severe and sustained degradation\no Severe and sustained degradation (scenario iii in the definition) constitutes\ndeforestation even if the land is not subsequently used for a non-forest land use.\no Loss of natural forest that meets this definition is considered to be deforestation\nregardless of whether or not it is legal.\no The definition of deforestation signifies \u201cgross deforestation\u201d of natural forest\nwhere \u201cgross\u201d is used in the sense of \u201ctotal; aggregate; without deduction for\nreforestation or other offset.\u201d (adapted from AFi, 2024).\n\u2022 Deforestation-free (also referred to as: no-deforestation): commodity production, sourcing,\nor financial investments that do not cause or contribute to deforestation.\no Deforestation-free refers to no gross deforestation of natural forests, which the\nAccountability Framework specifies as the appropriate policy and goal on this\ntopic for companies and supply chains.\no In the context of the Accountability Framework, deforestation refers to the loss of\nnatural forest (see definition of deforestation).\no The terms \u201cno-deforestation\u201d and \u201cdeforestation-free\u201d are used in favor of \u201czero\ndeforestation\u201d because \u201czero\u201d can imply an absolutist approach that may be at\nodds with the need sometimes to accommodate minimal levels of conversion at\nthe site level in the interest of facilitating optimal conservation and production\noutcomes (see AFi\u2019s definition for minimal level [of deforestation or conversion],\n2024) (adapted from AFi, 2024).\n\u2022 Deforestation- and conversion-free (also referred to as \"no-conversion\"): commodity\nproduction, sourcing, or financial investments that do not cause or contribute to\ndeforestation and the conversion of natural ecosystems.\no Conversion-free refers to no gross conversion of natural ecosystems, which the\nAccountability Framework specifies as the appropriate policy and goal on this\ntopic for companies and supply chains.\n75\n\no Deforestation-free refers to no gross deforestation of natural forests, which the\nAccountability Framework specifies as the appropriate policy and goal on this\ntopic for companies and supply chains.\no In the context of the Accountability Framework, deforestation refers to the loss of\nnatural forest (see definition of deforestation).\no The terms \u201cno-conversion\u201d, and \u201cdeforestation- and conversion-free\u201d are used in\nfavor of \u201czero-conversion\u201d because \u201czero\u201d can imply an absolutist approach that\nmay be at odds with the need to sometimes accommodate minimal levels of\nconversion at the site level in the interest of facilitating optimal conservation and\nproduction outcomes (see AFi\u2019s definition for minimal level [of deforestation or\nconversion], 2024) (adapted from AFi, 2024).\n\u2022 Disclosure volume: the volume that your organization includes in its disclosure.\nOrganizations are encouraged to report the \u201cTotal commodity volume\u201d as their \u201cDisclosure\nvolume\u201d, however certain volumes may be excluded.\n\u2022 Negligible risk: a conclusion, based on credible evidence, that it is exceedingly unlikely that\nmaterial produced in or sourced from a given context is non-compliant with one or more\naspects of a company\u2019s social and environmental commitments, policies, or other\nobligations.\no Criteria for determining negligible risk should be defined in each sourcing area and\nfor each aspect of a company\u2019s social and environmental commitments, policies,\nand other obligations. A given production area could be considered negligible risk\nfor one aspect of a company\u2019s social and environmental obligations but not\nnegligible risk for other aspects (adapted from AFi, 2024).\n\u2022 Production unit: a plantation, farm, ranch, or forest management unit. This includes all\nplots used for agriculture or forestry that are under one management, located in the same\ngeneral area, and share the same means of production. It also includes natural\necosystems, infrastructure, and other land within or associated with the plantation, farm,\nranch, or forest management unit.\no A production unit can be a contiguous land area (regardless of any internal\nsubdivisions) or a group of plots interspersed with other land units the same area\nor landscape and under the same management (AFi, 2024).\n\u2022 Sourcing area: an area or region from which materials in a supply chain originate.\no Sourcing areas could include a sourcing radius or a supply-shed around a first\npoint of collection or processing facility (e.g., a radius from a palm oil mill); a\ndefined set of production units supplying a particular aggregator or buyer (e.g. the\narea covered by a smallholder cooperative); or a landscape or subnational\njurisdiction (e.g. municipality) from which materials are sourced (AFi, 2024).\nAdditional \u2022 For information on DCF accounting and the methods to determine DCF, consult the joint AFi,\ninformation GHG protocol and SBTi FLAG guidance (2023)\n\u2022 For further information on DCF methodology and verification approaches, Proforest (2022)\nGeneric Verified Deforestation and Conversion Free (V-DCF) methodology is a high-level\nframework that provides the agricultural commodities sector with a consolidated, generic\napproach to confirming and demonstrating DCF and Verified-DCF.\n76\n\n\u2022 Refer to the AFi\u2019s operational guidance on Applying the Definitions Related to Deforestation and\nConversion, for further information on the distinction between \u2018no deforestation\u2019 and \u2018no-\ndeforestation and -conversion\u2019 policies and related status claims.\n\u2022 Use the CDP technical note on \u201cReporting progress on Deforestation- and Conversion-free value\nchains\u201d to get an overview of the stages and concepts related to DF and DCF value chains and\nhow the related information can be reported throughout Module 8.\nTags\nAuthority type All requesters\nEnvironmental Issue Question level F only\n(Theme)\nQuestionnaire sector Question level All except FS",

This\ninformation may also be passed from suppliers to buyers via business-to-business value chain\ncontrol mechanisms. Where suppliers are able to provide reliable data to their buyers regarding\nthe DF/DCF status of volumes that they are supplying, based on site-level assessment, this\nmay greatly decrease the monitoring burden on downstream companies. However, it is\nincumbent upon buyers to ensure that any such information is reliable.\n\u2022 The origin of commodities must first be traced to production units before monitoring of\nproduction units becomes a viable means of determining if volumes are DF/DCF. This question\ntherefore only applies to the volumes reported in column \u201c% of sourced volume traceable to\nproduction unit\u201d in 8.8.1.\n\u2022 The monitoring of the production unit should cover all deforestation and/or conversion in the\nproduction unit since the cutoff date, regardless of the current use of the land.\n% of disclosure volume determined as DF/DCF through monitoring of production unit (column 1)\n\u2022 This column is auto-calculated from the volumes disclosed in column 4 of 8.9.

Verification is a separate process, conducted by an independent party,\nfrom the initial process of determining volumes to be DF/DCF.\n\u2022 This verification is distinct from certification schemes used to determine DF/DCF status of\nvolumes, those volumes should be reported through 8.9 and 8.9.1.\n85\n\n% of your disclosure volume that is both determined as DF/DCF through monitoring of production unit\nand is verified as DF/DCF (column 6)\n\u2022 This column only appears if \u201cYes\u201d is selected in column 4 \u201cDF/DCF status verified\u201d.\n\u2022 As a result of the verification approach, indicate the percentage of your disclosure volume that\nis determined to be DF/DCF through monitoring of the production unit and that has also been\nverified as being DF/DCF in the reporting year.

This is\nmore specific than the country/area level, and could include a sourcing radius or a supply-shed\naround a first point of collection or processing facility (e.g., a radius from a palm oil mill); a\ndefined set of production units supplying a particular aggregator or buyer (e.g. the area covered\nby a smallholder cooperative); or a landscape or subnational jurisdiction (e.g. municipality)\nfrom which materials are sourced (adapted from AFi, 2024).\n\u2022 Where the organization can trace materials to a sourcing area in which no or negligible\ndeforestation and/or conversion has occurred since an appropriate cutoff date, they may\ngenerally consider all volumes sourced from that area to be DF/DCF. If using this approach,\norganizations must continue to monitor such sourcing areas to identify any change in the\noccurrence or risk of deforestation or conversion. Monitoring at this scale should include all\ndeforestation/conversion, not only land use change directly linked to the commodity of interest.\nIf there is recent ecosystem conversion linked to agriculture or forestry in a sourcing area,\nregardless of the direct driver or current land use, DF/DCF claims should not be made without\nfurther due diligence, monitoring, and assurance. This may necessitate monitoring at a finer\nscale and/or using data related to expansion of the commodity of interest or other publicly\navailable information. Organizations using this approach should disclose the methodology and\ndata used (Adapted from AFi 2022).\n\u2022 This risk level monitoring must be robust and evidence based. It should be specific and\nconsider all relevant aspects of the risks related to the commodities, locations, and suppliers\nunder assessment.

Grievance mechanisms\nmay be state-based or non-state-based and they may be judicial or non-judicial (AFi, 2024).\n\u2022 Landscape and jurisdictional approach: a muti-stakeholder collaborative strategy to advance\nshared sustainability goals and build resilience at landscape scale. A jurisdictional approach is\na landscape approach defined by administrative boundaries and with high level of government\ninvolvement.\n\u2022 Negligible risk: a conclusion, based on credible evidence, that it is exceedingly unlikely that\nmaterial produced in or sourced from a given context is non-compliant with one or more\naspects of a company\u2019s social and environmental commitments, policies, or other obligations.\no Criteria for determining negligible risk should be defined in each sourcing region and\nfor each aspect of a company\u2019s social and environmental commitments, policies, and\nother obligations. A given production area could be considered negligible risk for one\naspect of a company\u2019s social and environmental obligations but not negligible risk for\nother aspects (adapted from AFi, 2024).\n\u2022 Second-party verification: verification conducted by a related entity with an interest in the\ncompany or operation being assessed, such as the business customer of a\nproduction/processing operation or a contractor that also provides services other than\nverification (AFi, 2024).\n\u2022 Sourcing area: an area or region from which materials in a supply chain originate.\no Sourcing areas could include a sourcing radius or a supply-shed around a first point of\ncollection or processing facility (e.g., a radius from a palm oil mill); a defined set of\nproduction units supplying a particular aggregator or buyer (e.g. the area covered by a\nsmallholder cooperative); or a landscape or subnational jurisdiction (e.g. municipality)\nfrom which materials are sourced (AFi, 2024).\n\u2022 Third-party verification: verification conducted by an independent entity that does not provide\nother services to the company (AFi, 2024).\n\u2022 Verification: assessment and confirmation of compliance, performance, and/or actions relative\nto a stated commitment, policy, goal, target, or other obligation. Verification signifies that\ninformation is checked and confirmed by persons other than those involved in the operation or\nentity being assessed (AFi, 2024).\nAdditional Guidance on good practices for how to conduct a risk assessment and sourcing area monitoring\ninformation are provided by the Accountability Framework initiative\u2019s Operational Guidance on Supply Chain\nManagement (AFi, 2020) and Monitoring and Verification (AFi, 2020).

APP are\nphysically and ecologically fragile and provide important environmental services. These areas\nvary between properties and may be allocated within the Legal Reserve (WWF, 2015).\n\u2022 Rural Environmental Registry or CAR (Brazilian Forest Code): the central tool for rural\nproperties to become compliant with the Brazilian Forest Code requirements. All rural property\nowners must register their lands in CAR, including the location of APPs, Legal Reserves, and\nother elements. CAR is regulated by the National System of Information on the Environment\n(SINIMA) (WWF, 2015).\n\u2022 Terms of Commitment (Brazilian Forest Code): in Brazil, a formal document signed by the\nrural landowner in which he or she commits to redress the environmental deficit of the\nproperty, including, at least, commitments to conserve, reforest or restore APPs, Legal\nReserves and Restricted Use Areas. Legal Reserve areas may be restored or compensated\n(WWF, 2015).\nAdditional For an overview of the Brazilian Forest Code see WWF (2015), and for further information on\ninformation assessing compliance with the Forest Code consult Proforest (2017).\nTags\nAuthority type All requesters\nEnvironmental Issue Question level F only\n(Theme)\nQuestionnaire sector Question level All (except FS)\nLandscape and jurisdictional approaches and initiatives",

initiative.\n\u2022 Consider whether the landscape level initiative can be considered as a jurisdictional\ninitiative. If it is setting and monitoring outcomes at the level of a political boundary (for\nexample state/province/district/municipality), with direct engagement from the\ngovernment in supporting the outcomes, then this is a jurisdictional initiative (see\nexplanation of \u201cLandscape and jurisdictional initiative\u201d below).\n\u2022 You must only report engagement that was active during the reporting period.\n\u2022 Add a new row for each jurisdictional/landscape initiative you are engaged in.\nLandscape/jurisdiction ID (column 1)\n\u2022 Select a unique reference number for each disclosed landscape/jurisdictional initiative.\n124\n\n\u2022 This reference number will be used in 8.13.3 and should refer to the same initiative (e.g.,\nLJ1 should refer to the same landscape/jurisdictional initiative in both questions).\nName of initiative (column 2)\n\u2022 Provide details of the official name of the initiative.\n\u2022 This name may be the same as the landscape or jurisdiction area name in which the\ninitiative operates or a distinct name officially agreed upon by initiative stakeholders.\n\u2022 If the initiative has yet to be given an official name, state \u201cNot defined\u201d.\nCountry/area (column 3)\n\u2022 Indicate the country/area in which the initiative is located.\nName of landscape or jurisdictional area (column 4)\n\u2022 Provide details on the name of the landscape or jurisdictional area.\n\u2022 Names may be the jurisdictional boundary e.g., the subnational state, municipality,\nprovince or district.

They may be delineated based on river basins, seascapes,\necosystems, jurisdictional boundaries, or in other ways.\n\u2022 Landscape and Jurisdictional Approach: A muti-stakeholder collaborative strategy to\nadvance shared sustainability goals and build resilience at landscape scale. A jurisdictional\napproach is a landscape approach defined by administrative boundaries and with high level\nof government involvement.\n\u2022 Landscape and jurisdictional initiatives: the on-the-ground collaborative program to set\ncommon goals, take collective action while reconciling different interests, and monitor\nprogress towards improving social, environmental, and economic outcomes at a\nlandscape/jurisdictional scale.\n\u2022 Agroforestry: a land management approach that combines the production of trees with\nother crops and/or livestock. Trees have high adaptive capacity because they are deep\nrooted and have large reserves of water and nutrients, and are less susceptible than annual\ncrops to inter-annual variability or short-lived extreme events like droughts or floods.\n127\n\nAdditionally, trees improve soil quality and fertility by contributing to water retention and by\nreducing water stress during low rainfall years, and also have higher evapotranspiration\nrates than row crops or pastures and can thus pump excess water out of the soil. Trees\ncan also reduce the impacts of weather extremes such as droughts or torrential rain and\ncan stabilize the soil against landslides and raise infiltration rates.\n\u2022 Assessment Framework: provides a structure for assessing progress towards the pre-\ndefined goals of a landscape or jurisdictional initiative. It defines the indicators that\ncollectively characterize the sustainability of a landscape, and can provide mechanisms for\nmeasuring accountability and tracking performance metrics.\n\u2022 Conversion: loss of a natural ecosystem as a result of its replacement with agriculture or\nanother land use, or due to a profound and sustained change in the natural ecosystem\u2019s\nspecies composition, structure, or function.\no Deforestation is one form of conversion (conversion of natural forests).\no Conversion includes severe degradation or the introduction of management\npractices that result in a profound and sustained change in the ecosystem\u2019s\nspecies composition, structure, or function.\no Change to natural ecosystems that meets this definition is considered to be\nconversion regardless of whether or not it is legal (AFi, 2024).\n\u2022 Deforestation: loss of natural forest as a result of: i) conversion to agriculture or other non-\nforest land use; ii) conversion to a tree plantation; or iii) severe and sustained degradation.\no Severe and sustained degradation (scenario iii in the definition) constitutes\ndeforestation even if the land is not subsequently used for non-forest land use.\no Loss of natural forest that meets this definition is considered to be deforestation\nregardless of whether or not it is legal.\no The definition of deforestation signifies \u201cgross deforestation\u201d of natural forest\nwhere \u201cgross\u201d is used in the sense of \u201ctotal; aggregate; without deduction for\nreforestation or other offset.\u201d (adapted from AFi, 2024)\n\u2022 Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC): a collective human right of indigenous peoples\nand local communities to give and withhold their consent prior to the commencement of\nany activity that may affect their rights, land, resources, territories, livelihoods, and food\nsecurity. It is a right exercised through representatives of their own choosing and in a\nmanner consistent with their own customs, values, and norms (AFi, 2024).\n\u2022 Grievance mechanism: any routinized process through which grievances concerning\nbusiness-related negative impacts on human rights or the environment can be raised, and\nremedy can be sought. Grievance mechanisms may be State-based or non-State based\nand they may be judicial or non-judicial (AFi, 2024).\n\u2022 Landscape sustainability assessment: an assessment, usually conducted through an\nestablished framework, that provides a holistic overview of the landscape in relation to\nhuman, social, economic, and environmental factors and issues.\n\u2022 Natural ecosystem: an ecosystem that substantially resembles - in terms of species\ncomposition, structure, and ecological function - one that is or would be found in a given\narea in the absence of major human impacts. This includes human-managed ecosystems\nwhere much of the natural species composition, structure, and ecological function are\npresent (AFi, 2024).\n\u2022 Restoration: the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem, and its associated\nconservation values, that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed (SER, 2004).\n\u2022 Smallholder: small-scale agricultural or forest products producers that are distinct from\nlarger-scale producers found in similar contexts by virtue of many or all of the following\ncharacteristics:\no High degree of dependence on family labor.\no Profits accrue primarily to the farm/forest owner and their family.\no The farm/forest provides a primary source of income livelihood for the smallholder.\n128\n\no Production units have a relatively small land footprint (relative to the range of\nproduction unit sizes for the given commodity and region).\no Household resources are allocated to both food crops and cash crops.\no Relatively low use of agricultural inputs and generally low productivity and yields.\no Significant economic constraints, such as lack of capital assets and low access to\nfinance.\no Significant information constraints, including lack of technical knowledge and low\naccess to market information (adapted from AFi, 2024).\n\u2022 Traceability: the ability to follow a product or its components through stages of the\nupstream value chain (e.g., production, processing, manufacturing, and distribution)\n(adapted from AFi, 2024).\n\u2022 Individual claim: a type of claim about the direct actions/investments and progress on\nimplementing these by an organization, or the attribution of performance outcomes that\nresulted solely from the organizations actions/investment.\n\u2022 Collective claim: the most broadly applicable type of claim about landscape-scale\nperformance outcomes. It recognizes the general or proportional contributions to the\ncollective efforts & outcomes achieved.\nAdditional \u2022 For information on good practices for engaging in landscape and jurisdictional initiatives\ninformation and how to implement collective monitoring frameworks, see ISEAL\u2019s Effective company\nactions in landscapes and jurisdictions.\n\u2022 For further details on what constitutes an organization investment or action in a\nlandscape, refer to: ISEAL (2022) Position Paper \u201c01 Landscapes position paper on what\nconstitutes a company landscape investment or action\u201d.\n\u2022 For further details on what minimum and supporting information an organization would\nneed to include as part of making an effective claim about landscape investments and\nactions, refer to: ISEAL (2023) Position Paper \u201c02 Landscapes position paper on making\neffective company claims about landscape investments and actions\u201d.\n\u2022 For further details on the claims an organization can make about their contributions to\nlandscape performance outcomes, refer to: ISEAL (2023) Position Paper \u201c03 Landscape\nposition paper on making effective company claims about contributions to landscape\noutcomes\u201d.\n\u2022 Information on how CDP assesses the credibility of disclosed landscape and jurisdictional\ninitiatives can be found here.\nTags\nAuthority type All requesters\nEnvironmental Issue Question level F only\n(Theme)\nQuestionnaire sector Question level All (except FS)",

This would be a point in the past you can provide reliable data on\naspects covered by the measured outcomes informed in column 16 (Measured outcomes\nto date).\nExplanation of \u2022 Afforestation: establishment of forest through planting and/or deliberate seeding on land\nterms that, until then, was not classified as forest, which implies a transformation of land use\nfrom non-forest to forest (FAO, 2015).\n\u2022 Agroforestry: a land management approach that combines the production of trees with\nother crops and/or livestock. Trees have high adaptive capacity because they are deep\nrooted and have large reserves of water and nutrients, and are less susceptible than annual\ncrops to inter-annual variability or short-lived extreme events like droughts or floods.\nAdditionally, trees improve soil quality and fertility by contributing to water retention and by\nreducing water stress during low rainfall years, and also have higher evapotranspiration\nrates than row crops or pastures and can thus pump excess water out of the soil. Trees\ncan also reduce the impacts of weather extremes such as droughts or torrential rain and\ncan stabilize the soil against landslides and raise infiltration rates.\n\u2022 Biodiversity offsetting: measures taken to compensate for any residual significant,\nadverse impacts that cannot be avoided, minimized and / or rehabilitated or restored, in\norder to achieve no net loss or a net gain of biodiversity. Offsets can take the form of\npositive management interventions such as restoration of degraded habitat, arrested\ndegradation or averted risk, protecting areas where there is imminent or projected loss of\nbiodiversity (BBOP 2012).\n\u2022 Latitude and longitude: geographic coordinates that specify, respectively, the north-south\nand east-west position, of a point on the Earth's surface. These coordinates are expressed\nas angular measures and thus, latitude can vary from 0 to +/-90; longitude can vary from 0\nto +/-180.\n\u2022 Natural ecosystem: an ecosystem that substantially resembles - in terms of species\ncomposition, structure, and ecological function - one that is or would be found in a given\narea in the absence of major human impacts. This includes human-managed ecosystems\nwhere much of the natural species composition, structure, and ecological function are\npresent (AFi, 2024).\n\u2022 Set-aside land: land owned/managed by the company that is not used for production or\nplanned development and is set-aside for conservation purposes.\n\u2022 Threatened and protected species: all species assessed as a threatened category on\nIUCN\u2019s Red List of Threatened Species, as well as other species considered threatened or\notherwise protected by international, national or subnational laws and regulation.\nTags\nAuthority type All requesters\nEnvironmental Issue Question level F only\n(Theme)\nQuestionnaire sector Question level All (except FS)\n139\n\n140\n\nModule 9: Environmental Performance \u2013 Water security\nModule The promotion of water security for all is supported when companies:\nOverview\n\u2022 Reduce their dependency on freshwater sources and track their progress;\n\u2022 Collect and share volumetric data on their interactions with water resources.\n\u2022 Are aware of the water intensity of their value creation.\n\u2022 Consider water throughout their value chain, beyond the fence-line of their direct\noperations.\nClean freshwater is becoming increasingly scarce, and this can impact operations relying on large\nvolumes of water. The information in this module enables CDP data users to understand an\norganization\u2019s exclusions, organization-wide water accounting, facility level water accounting &\nverification, water efficiency and water intensity, products and services, and water-related targets.\nThe questions in this module allow your organization to demonstrate how well it understands its\ncorporate hydrology by providing information on the monitoring of relevant water aspects. This\nincludes volumetric data on withdrawals, including from water stressed areas, discharges by level\nof treatment, and consumption. CDP also requests companies to comment on their projections\nfor water accounting data.\nIn addition to volumetric data, in order to protect water quality, companies are requested to report\non their emissions to water and their use of hazardous substances.\nFor organizations responding to a request from a CDP Supply Chain member, this module also\nincludes questions on the impact of facilities on requesting supply chain members (section 9.4).\nNote:\nThroughout the water security module, CDP has broadened the scope of questions about the\nsupply chain to include other phases of the value chain. This will be particularly relevant to\ncompanies whose activities may be constrained or otherwise affected by water related issues\nbeyond their direct operations and supply chains. It reflects a widening of company focus to, and\ngreater investor interest in, risk exposure, opportunities and impacts within the value chain.\nDisclosure note\nCDP\u2019s approach to reporting water accounting data\n\u2022 When reporting volumetric data please read the guidance for each question as well as the\nCDP Technical Note on water accounting definitions.\n\u2022 To reduce their impact on water ecosystems and resources as well as their need to\nmanage water-related risks, organizations should minimize and be able to account for all\ntheir interaction with water. For this reason, CDP\u2019s focus is the collection of information to\ndetermine how well a company understands the flow of water into and out of its\nboundaries, and whether they have robust monitoring and accounting in place for all\naspects of their water use.\n\u2022 Definitions: CDP is looking for comparable data, reported against a standard\nmethodology/definition. To ensure the quality of our data and a fair scoring methodology,\nCDP definitions should be used for all disclosures. This is particularly relevant where there\nis a lack of standardization. Companies must not provide water accounting data that\ndoes not align with the definitions given. Please refer to CDP\u2019s Technical Note on water\naccounting.\n\u2022 Units: Volumes must be reported in megaliters per year (1 megaliter = 1 million liters or\n1,000 m3) in all questions, unless otherwise stated.\n141\n\n\u2022 Blank cells: Please ensure when responding to these water accounting questions that\ncells are only intentionally left blank if you have no data to disclose. Blank cells are\ninterpreted as non-disclosure, i.e. information is not available due to lack of measurement\nor choosing not to disclose, and are therefore awarded no points by the scoring\nmethodology.\n\u2022 Values of zero: entering a zero implies a measurement has been made, and the value is\nzero. For example, a value of zero consumption reported indicates that no water is\nincorporated into products or waste products or lost by evaporation from the company.\nDo not use a zero to indicate a lack of data. If a company enters a zero for discharge, it\nshould provide an explanation.\n\u2022 Data accuracy: CDP recognizes that there may be uncertainty linked to water accounting\ninformation that could impact on data accuracy. Uncertainty can arise from data gaps,\nassumptions, metering/measurement constraints including equipment accuracy, data\nmanagement, etc. The emphasis should be on reporting transparently and on providing\nan explanation for why reported data is uncertain or wholly or partially estimated or\nmodelled, rather than sourced from direct measurements.\nSector-specific \u2022 Additional questions on organization-wide water accounting and water efficiency and\ncontent water intensity for the following high-impact sectors: Agricultural commodities, Coal,\nChemicals, Electric Utilities, Food, Beverage & Tobacco, Oil & gas, Metals & Minning.\n\u2022 Additional response options are presented in:\no 9.2 for the Oil & Gas, Metals & Minning, and Coal sectors\no 9.2.5, 9.2.6, 9.8 and 9.9 for the Food, Beverage & Tobacco and Agricultural\ncommodities sectors\no 9.2.1, 9.7 and 9.7.1 for the Electric utilities sector\no 9.6 and 9.6.1 for the Chemicals sector\no 9.10 and 9.10.1 for the Coal and Metals & Minning sectors\no 9.11 and 9.11.1 for the Oil & gas sector\n142\n\nExclusions",

Note that estimation or modelling are valid sources\nof data.\n\u2022 Water withdrawals \u2013 quality data: In hydropower operations please consider the\nmonitoring of reservoir water quality when responding to this question.\n\u2022 Water recycling & reuse: CDP recognizes that water recycling and reuse practices\nin wind, solar and hydropower operations are less common and less relevant. In\nhydropower operations, only pumped-storage operations can be considered for\nwater reuse. It is expected that most organizations will report 0 for their hydropower\noperations in this question. In light of this:\no Organizations with more than 70% of their power generation coming from\nthese sources may select \u201cNot relevant\u201d.\no Organizations with less than 70% of their power generation coming from\nthese sources should select the response that best reflects their company\u2019s\nmonitoring activity in their operations outside the hydropower, wind or solar\ngeneration sources. Indicate in column 4 (Please explain) how the use of\nthese sources affects the proportion of sites monitored that you are\nreporting.\n\u2022 Water discharges \u2013 total volume: CDP recognizes the difficulty in accounting for\nsome elements of the hydropower operations\u2019 water balance, specifically seepage or\nthose that are outside the organization\u2019s control such as third-party withdrawals.\nIn hydropower operations, water discharge includes the dam outlet and the spillway,\nunderground seepage and third-party withdrawals from the reservoir (for example a\nmunicipal water plant abstracting from the reservoir).\nD = Dam outlet + Spillway + Seepage + Third-party withdrawals from the reservoir\nNote that estimation or modelling are valid sources of data.\n\u2022 Water discharges \u2013 volumes by destination: In hydropower operations, water\ndischarge includes the dam outlet and the spillway, underground seepage and third-\nparty withdrawals from the reservoir (for example a municipal water plant\nabstracting from the reservoir). Organizations should strive to monitor those\ndestinations if they would result in an estimated error in their water balance of more\nthan 5%. Note that estimation or modelling are valid sources of data.\n\u2022 Water discharges \u2013 volumes by treatment method: CDP recognizes that discharge\nquality data is rarely measured in organizations operating with wind, solar and\nhydropower generation sources.

Indicate in column 4 (Please explain) how the use of\nthese sources affects the proportion of sites monitored that you are\nreporting.\n\u2022 Water consumption \u2013 total volume: Water consumption in hydropower operations\nincludes evaporation from the reservoir surface as well as the balance between\nwithdrawals and discharges. Organizations should strive to estimate evaporated\nvolumes if they would result in an estimated error in their water balance of more\nthan 5%.\nSector-specific guidance for metals & mining and coal sectors\nGeneral\n\u2022 This guidance is specific to companies responding to a metals & mining or coal\nsector request. You should first read the guidance for this question that applies to\nall companies. This is additional to the general guidance and does not replace it.\n\u2022 Monitoring produced water volumes is common practice in the mining industry.\nThis information is requested as it indicates that an organization is striving for\ncomprehensive water accounting and aiming to manage all types of water entering\nits company boundaries.\nWater aspect (column 0)\n\u2022 Water withdrawals \u2013 total volume: In line with CDP\u2019s definition of water withdrawal,\nfor the mining industry water withdrawals include water diversions to enable\ncomparability \u2013 because it is water that crosses the company boundary.\n153\n\n\u2022 Water discharges \u2013 total volume: In line with CDP\u2019s definition of water discharges,\nfor the mining industry sector discharges comprise all water outputs including water\ndiversions\u2013 because it is water that crosses the company boundary.\n\u2022 Evaporation and water entrained in waste material should not be considered\ndischarges but as part of the consumption volumes.\n\u2022 Water consumption \u2013 total volume: Organizations in the mining industry should\nreport on the volumes of water lost to evaporation from open water surfaces,\nentrained in remaining waste material (such as tailings, coarse rejects, and\nconcentrates), or water stored over the reporting year.\n\u2022 Water withdrawals - quality: This water aspect is particularly relevant for\ncompanies with mining activities. Monitoring this parameter is in line with ICMM's\nand WAF of the Mineral Council of Australia recommendation of monitoring the\nquality of water. Companies with mining activities may select the appropriate\npercentage.\n\u2022 Water discharges - temperature: This water aspect is particularly relevant for\ncompanies with metallurgy activities and smelters, who have cooling operations.\nCompanies with processing activities may select the appropriate percentage.\nSector-specific guidance for oil & gas sector\nGeneral\n\u2022 This guidance is specific to companies responding to an oil & gas sector request.\nYou should first read the guidance for this question that applies to all companies.\nThis is additional to the general guidance and does not replace it.\n\u2022 Monitoring produced water volumes is common practice in the oil & gas industry.\nThis information is requested as it indicates that an organization is striving for\ncomprehensive water accounting and aiming to manage all types of water entering\nits company boundaries.\nWater aspect (column 0)\n\u2022 Water withdrawals \u2013 total volume: In the oil & gas sector, the reporting of water\nwithdrawals volumes typically does not include produced water. To enable\ncomparability, CDP requires all companies to include produced water volumes in\ntheir withdrawals disclosure.\n\u2022 Water discharges \u2013 total volume: In oil production, as part of secondary and\ntertiary recovery operations, water-based fluids (from various sources) may be used\nto maintain the pressure, and to displace the hydrocarbons and move them towards\nthe production wells. For CDP disclosure, organizations must consider these\nvolumes as part of their discharges to groundwater bodies in order to have an\naccurate water balance.\n\u2022 Produced water associated with your oil & gas sector activities - total volume:\nSelect \u201cnot applicable\u201d only if your organization does not include an \u201cupstream\u201d\nbusiness division.\nExplanation of \u2022 Boundaries of your organization: This term is key within CDP water accounting\nterms\ndefinitions and is a management boundary, rather than a physical boundary or a\nlegal entity. Water is considered to have crossed the boundary of your organization,\nat either the corporate or site level, when your organization in any way uses it,\ncomes into contact with it, is required to manage it or when it becomes incorporated\n154\n\ninto your products. It therefore includes any water use and management by your\norganization outside of its physical corporate fence; for example, to provide a street\ncleaning service or in fields remote from a processing plant. The scope of this\norganizational boundary is defined by your chosen reporting boundary.\n\u2022 Entrained water (Metals & mining and coal sectors only): In the mining industry,\nentrained water refers to the volumes of water in the raw material.\n\u2022 Measurement: The collection of quantified data for a water aspect - either as a\nsingle volume/quality figure or an aggregation of volumes/ quality figures.\n\u2022 Monitoring: This is the tracking of measurements over time, i.e. a trend or indication\nof change in measured figures.\n\u2022 Produced water (Oil & gas sector only): Water that is brought to the surface during\nthe production of hydrocarbons including formation water, flow-back water and\ncondensation water (IPIECA \u201cOil and gas industry guidance on voluntary\nsustainability reporting\u201d, 4th edition, 2020).\n\u2022 Produced water: Water which enters the organization\u2019s boundary as a result of the\nextraction, processing, or use of any raw material, so that it must be managed by\nthe organization. When reporting to CDP, this water should not be counted as\nrecycled water when put to use within a single cycle of a business process.\nExamples of produced water include moisture derived from vegetation such as in\nsugar cane crushing and the water content in crude oil. (Note that companies with\noil and gas activities should refer to CDP\u2019s sector specific guidance for this water\naspect).\n\u2022 Safely managed WASH services: The universal provision of safely managed water,\nsanitation, and hygiene services has dedicated targets within the Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals (SDG 6.1 and 6.2).

You should first read the guidance for this question that applies to all\ncompanies. This is additional to the general guidance and does not replace it.\nWater aspect (column 0)\n\u2022 Total withdrawals: CDP recognizes the difficulty in accounting for some elements of\nthe hydropower operations\u2019 water balance, specifically surface runoff or elements that\nare outside the organization\u2019s control such as third-party discharges into the\nreservoir. Water withdrawals into hydropower operations include river inflow, surface\nrunoff and precipitation onto the reservoir surface, as well as third-party discharges\ninto the reservoir:\nW = Precipitation + River Inflow + Runoff + Third-party discharges into reservoir\nOrganizations should strive to include volumes for those sources if they would result in an\nestimated error in the water balance of more than 5% and take a consistent approach\nthroughout the questionnaire. In column 6 (Please explain), you should explain which\nsources you have included or excluded. Note that estimation or modelling are valid\nsources of data.\n\u2022 Total discharges: CDP recognizes the difficulty in accounting for some elements of the\nhydropower operations\u2019 water balance, specifically seepage or those that are outside\nthe organization\u2019s control such as third-party withdrawals.\nIn hydropower operations, water discharge includes the dam outlet and the spillway,\nunderground seepage and third-party withdrawals from the reservoir (for example a\nmunicipal water plant abstracting from the reservoir).\nD = Dam outlet + Spillway + Seepage + Third-party withdrawals from the reservoir\nOrganizations should strive to include volumes for those destinations and explain which of\nthese elements are included or excluded if they would result in an estimated error in the\nwater balance of more than 5%. In column 6, you should explain which destinations you\nhave included or excluded and take a consistent approach throughout the questionnaire.\nNote that estimation or modelling are valid sources of data.\n\u2022 Total consumption: Water consumption in hydropower operations includes\nevaporation from the reservoir surface as well as the balance between withdrawals and\n166\n\ndischarges. Although organizations should estimate evaporated volumes if they would\nresult in an estimated error in the water balance of more than 5%, you may consider\nvariations in storage as a valid measure of your consumption volumes rather than\ncalculating evaporation and the balance between all withdrawals and discharges. This\ninformation is usually easily derived from water level measurements.\nIn column 6 (Please explain) provide your approach to reporting a total consumption figure.\nPlease explain (column 6)\n\u2022 In the case of hydropower operations, indicate which elements of water withdrawals\n(river inflow, surface runoff, precipitation onto the reservoir surface and third-party\ndischarges into the reservoir), discharges (spillway, underground seepage, and third-\nparty withdrawals from the reservoir) and consumption are you taking into account\nwhen providing your response to column 1 (Volume). You may indicate the method\nfollowed to obtain it, e.g. direct monitoring, estimation from a hydrological model, or\nother secondary source of information.\n\u2022 Additionally, you may choose to specify the evaporated volumes if your organization\ncollects this data.\n\u2022 Note: CDP expects withdrawals, discharges and consumption figures to balance\n(approximately; +/- 5%) so if there is a good reason why this cannot happen, it should\nbe explained in the \"Total consumption\" row.\nSector-specific guidance for metals & mining and coal sectors\nGeneral\n\u2022 This guidance is specific to companies responding to a metals & mining or coal sector\nrequest. You should first read the guidance for this question that applies to all\ncompanies. This is additional to the general guidance and does not replace it.\nWater aspect (column 0)\n\u2022 Water withdrawals: In line with CDP\u2019s definition of water withdrawal, for the mining\nindustry water withdrawals include water diversions to enable comparability \u2013 because\nit is water that crosses the company boundary.\n\u2022 Water discharges: In line with CDP\u2019s definition of water discharges, for the mining\nindustry discharges comprise all water outputs including water diversions \u2013 because it\nis water that crosses the company boundary. Evaporation and water entrained in waste\nmaterial should not be considered discharges but as part of the consumption\nvolumes.\n\u2022 Water consumption: Water consumption in the mining industry should report on the\nvolumes of water lost to evaporation from open water surfaces, entrained in remaining\nwaste material (such as tailings, coarse rejects, and concentrates), or water stored over\nthe reporting year.\nSector-specific guidance for oil & gas sector\nGeneral\n\u2022 This guidance is specific to companies responding to an oil & gas sector request. You\nshould first read the guidance for this question that applies to all companies. This is\nadditional to the general guidance and does not replace it.\nWater aspect (column 0)\n\u2022 Total withdrawals: In the oil & gas sector, the reporting of water withdrawals volumes\ntypically does not include produced water. To enable comparability, CDP requires all\n167\n\ncompanies to include produced water volumes in their withdrawals disclosure, in order\nto have an accurate water balance.\n\u2022 As part of groundwater withdrawal volumes (be it from renewable or non-renewable\nsources), organizations should include all withdrawals from aquifers (other than the\nformation being exploited). These withdrawals may be intended for any use in the\norganization, including injection to maintain well pressure or as part of the fracture\nfluids.\n\u2022 Total discharges: In oil production, as part of secondary and tertiary recovery\noperations, water-based fluids (from various sources) may be used to maintain the\npressure, and to displace the hydrocarbons and move them towards the production\nwells. For CDP disclosure, organizations must report these volumes as discharges to\ngroundwater bodies, to enable comparability and have an accurate water balance.\nExplanation of terms \u2022 Water balance: An account of the volumes of water flowing into and leaving an\norganization across its boundary. When the two volumes are equal, the net water\nbalance will be zero.\n\u2022 Water consumption: The amount of water that is drawn into the boundaries of the\norganization (or facility) and not discharged back to the water environment or a third\nparty over the course of the reporting period. It is important to distinguish the term\n\u2018consumption\u2019 from the term \u2018water withdrawal\u2019 or \u2018water use\u2019. Water consumed is\nwater that during the reporting year:\no has been incorporated into products, crops or waste\no has evaporated or transpired\no consumed by humans or livestock\no has been stored in a controlled manner because it is polluted to the point of\nbeing unusable by other users, and so that it does not leave the organization\u2019s\nboundary\no has been stored during the reporting year for use or discharge in a subsequent\nreporting period\no is otherwise excluded from discharges out of the organization\u2019s boundary so\nthat it is no longer available for use by the ecosystem or local community.\nConsumption may be measured directly or modelled, or it can be calculated by\nsubtracting the total water discharge from company boundary from total water\nwithdrawn into the company boundary during the reporting period. As CDP data users\nrequire comparability, all disclosing companies should use this method.\nIf the company discharges more water than it withdraws, for example, because it has\nused and then discharged previously stored water, a negative consumption value is\npossible. This would indicate a net contribution to the water environment in the\nreporting year.\n\u2022 Water discharges \u2013 total volume(s): The sum of effluents and other water leaving the\norganization\u2019s boundary and released to surface water, groundwater water or to third\nparties over the course of the reporting period. This includes all water leaving the\ncompany boundary, whether it is:\no considered used or unused\no released through a defined discharge point (point source discharge), or\no released over land in a dispersed or undefined manner (non-point source\ndischarge), or as\no wastewater removed from the organization via truck.\nWater discharge can be authorized (in accordance with discharge consent) or\nunauthorized (if discharge consent is exceeded).\n\u2022 Water diversions (Metals & mining and coal sectors only): According to the Water\nAccounting Framework from the Mineral Council of Australia water diversions are\nflows from an input to an output without being utilized by the operational facility. The\nflow is not stored with the intention of being used in a task or treated.\n168\n\nExample response\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\nWater Volume Comparison Primary reason for Five- Primary reason for Please explain\naspect (megaliters with previous comparison with year forecast\n/year) reporting previous reporting forecast\nyear year\nTotal 32,596,140 About the Increase/decrease Lower Investment in water- Description for \u2018\u2019comparison\nwithdrawals same in efficiency smart with previous reporting\ntechnology/process year\u201d and \u201cfive-year\nforecast\u201d thresholds:\nDeviation +/- 5% = about\nthe same; Deviation\nbetween +/- 5-15% = higher\n/ lower; Deviation > +/- 15%\n= much higher / lower.\nWater withdrawals\nremained about the same\ncompared to the previous\nyear despite an increase in\nproduction thanks to water\nefficiency measures and\ndivestment from thermal\ncoal operations.

This question also\nincentivizes organizations to assess anticipated forward trends in withdrawals from water\nstressed areas, encouraging a transition towards business models which do not pose threats\nto rivers, lakes, aquifers, and streams.\nThe data requested assists the assessment of your organization\u2019s dependence on potentially\ncontested sources (regardless of whether your facility itself is located in a stressed area), as\nwell as your potential impact on sensitive locations.\n174\n\nWater stress is a driver of business risk and, as stress is likely to worsen, transparency is\ncritical. Understanding elevated business risk due to operations in water stressed areas is\nimportant for the investor community, and this question allows data users to review the trend\nin dependency on water from stressed basins.\nKnowledge of water-related hot spots helps your organization identify where water stress\nmay be affecting its operations, now or in the future, as well as to prioritize your sustainable\nwater management practices.\nResponse options\nPlease complete the following table:\n1 2 3 4 5\nWithdrawals are from Volume withdrawn Comparison with Primary reason for Five-year forecast\nareas with water stress from areas with water previous reporting year comparison with\nstress (megaliters) previous reporting year\nSelect from: Numerical field [enter a Select from: Select from: Select from:\n\u2022 Yes number from 0- \u2022 Much lower \u2022 Change in\n\u2022 No 999,999,999,999 using a \u2022 Lower accounting \u2022 Much lower\n\u2022 Unknown maximum of two \u2022 About the same methodology \u2022 Lower\ndecimal places] \u2022 Higher \u2022 Divestment from \u2022 About the same\n\u2022 Much higher water intensive \u2022 Higher\n\u2022 This is our first year \u2022 Much higher\ntechnology/process\nof measurement \u2022 Unknown\n\u2022 Facility closure\n\u2022 Facility expansion\n\u2022 Increase/decrease\nin business activity\n\u2022 Increase/decrease\nin efficiency\n\u2022 Investment in water-\nsmart\ntechnology/process\n\u2022 Maximum potential\nvolume reduction\nalready achieved\n\u2022 Mergers and\nacquisitions\n\u2022 Unknown\n\u2022 Other, please specify\n175\n\n6 7 8 9\nPrimary reason for forecast % of total withdrawals Identification tool Please explain\nthat are withdrawn from areas\nwith water stress\nSelect from: [Auto-calculated] Select all that apply: Text field [maximum 5,000\n\u2022 Change in accounting \u2022 WRI Aqueduct characters]\nmethodology \u2022 WWF Water Risk Filter\n\u2022 Divestment from water \u2022 Other, please specify\nintensive\ntechnology/process\n\u2022 Facility closure\n\u2022 Facility expansion\n\u2022 Increase/decrease in\nbusiness activity\n\u2022 Increase/decrease in\nefficiency\n\u2022 Investment in water-smart\ntechnology/process\n\u2022 Maximum potential volume\nreduction already achieved\n\u2022 Mergers and acquisitions\n\u2022 Unknown\n\u2022 Other, please specify\n[Fixed row]\nRequested content General\n\u2022 Refer to CDP\u2019s water accounting definitions and the Explanation of terms for this\nquestion before completing the table.\n\u2022 Organizations should report which approach/tool they use to assess whether their\nwithdrawals are from a \u201cstressed area\u201d. They should explain the approach taken and\nwhich data sets were used to assess \u201cwater stress\u201d.\n\u2022 As good practice, a water-stressed area should be measured, at the catchment level\nas a minimum.\n\u2022 Credible, publicly available tools for assessing levels of water stress include WRI\nAqueduct Water Risk Atlas, WWF Water Risk Filter, (see Additional information for more\ndetails about these tools).\n\u2022 Commonly accepted global risk indicators to assess areas as water stressed in\nterms of quantity and their thresholds for reporting to CDP include:\no Water availability - greater than \u2018High risk\u2019: 3.4 (WWF Water Risk Filter).\nWWF recommends that users also take into consideration \u2018Medium risk\u2019:\n>2.6.\n\u00a7 The WWF Water Risk Filter\u2019s risk category \u2018Water Availability\u2019\nintegrates the State of Nature layer for Water Availability\nrecommended for the Science-based Targets for Nature (SBTN) Step\n1: Assess and Step 2: Interpret & Prioritize. The SBTN\u2019s State of\nNature layer for Water Availability is calculated based on a multi-\nmodel approach which integrates the best available global water\nscarcity risk indicators: Water depletion, Baseline water stress, and\nBlue water scarcity. In addition, WWF has incorporated an indicator\n176\n\non groundwater availability in the WWF Water Risk Filter\u2019s risk\ncategory \u2018Water Availability\u2019.\n\u00a7 WWF recommends using the \u2018Drought\u2019 risk category as\nsupplementary information to help in interpreting results and\nprioritizing sites in water stressed areas, as droughts can exacerbate\nwater stress/water availability.\no Baseline water stress - equal to/greater than \u2018High\u2019: 40-80% (WRI Aqueduct\nWater Risk Atlas). This refers to the ratio of total annual water withdrawals to\navailable renewable water supply.\no Baseline water depletion - equal to/greater than \u2018High\u2019: 50-75% (WRI\nAqueduct Water Risk Atlas). This refers to the ratio of total annual water\nconsumption to available renewable water supply\n\u2022 Organizations can complement the results of these tools with their own\nassessments or by using other methodologies. Some companies will use more\ngranular level data and local knowledge of the basins in which they operate to assess\nwhich withdrawals are from stressed areas. For example, an organization may\nconsider its facility to be in a water-stressed sub basin or other smaller geographic\nlevel, though a global data set suggests that the particular catchment is not stressed.\n\u2022 Many national and regional water authorities will also have suitable maps, databases\nand environmental assessments available. (These may be included in the\nFAO/AquaStat database, or in reports of progress against SDG 6.4.2.)\n\u2022 Note that this question asks about the location of withdrawal sources rather than\nyour facilities. In most cases, these will not be different at a catchment level. If\nsupplying data based on the location of facilities because the exact location of\nwithdrawal sources is unknown, indicate this in column 9 \u201cPlease explain\u201d.\nWithdrawals are from areas with water stress (column 1)\n\u2022 If you select \u201cNo\u201d, columns 2 \u201cVolume withdrawn from areas with water stress\n(megaliters)\u201d to 7 \u201c% of total withdrawals that are withdrawn from areas of water\nstress\u201d will not be presented.\n\u2022 If you select \u201cUnknown\u201d, columns 2 \u201cVolume withdrawn from areas with water stress\n(megaliters)\u201d to 8 \u201cIdentification tool\u201d will not be presented.\nVolume withdrawn from areas with water stress (megaliters) (column 2)\n\u2022 Your disclosure should include all withdrawals within stressed areas and all sources\nlisted in 9.2.7, including third party suppliers. Do not include produced water or\ndesalinated water.\n\u2022 Report volumetric data in megaliters per year for the reporting year (1 megaliter = 1\nmillion liters or 1,000m3). You may provide an estimate and explain why in column 9\n\u201cPlease explain\u201d.\n\u2022 Note that a zero should only be used for reporting zero volumes and not for an\nabsence of data.\nComparison with previous reporting year / Five-year forecast (columns 3, 5)\n\u2022 CDP does not define the threshold for considering a value as \u201cmuch higher\u201d rather\nthan simply \u201chigher\u201d (or \u201cmuch lower\u201d / \u201clower\u201d). CDP requests this information from\nmany different industries with huge variations in water use, and it would therefore be\ndifficult to provide a universal threshold that is meaningful (as proportions will equate\nto different absolute values and impacts). CDP recommends that you define your\nown threshold for what is \u201cmuch higher\u201d (and \u201cmuch lower\u201d) and apply it consistently\nso that each year the reported data for this question is comparable and data users\n177\n\ncan track your water accounts more effectively. A company-specific explanation for\nthese thresholds should be provided in column 9 \u201cPlease explain\u201d.\n\u2022 The threshold defined for \u201cmuch higher\u201d / \u201chigher\u201d (and \u201cmuch lower\u201d / \u201clower\u201d) should\nbe the same for column 3 \u201cComparison with previous reporting year\u201d and column 5\n\u201cFive-year forecast\u201d.\n\u2022 Comparison with previous reporting year: If the data was not previously reported, but\nwas collected, you may choose to indicate a comparison with the previous year or\nselect \u201cThis is our first year of measurement\u201d. In either case, use the \u201cPlease explain\u201d\ncolumn to provide details about the information reported.\n\u2022 In some cases, the \u201cComparison with previous reporting year\u201d for the % withdrawn\nfrom areas with water stress may be different to the net change in volume withdrawn\nfrom water stressed areas compared to the previous reporting year. In these cases,\nthe organization should state the volumetric comparison between the current and\nprevious reporting year in column 9 \u201cPlease explain\u201d. This would be applicable, for\nexample, when an organization has \u201cmuch higher\u201d total company-wide withdrawals\ncompared to the previous reporting year, but their absolute withdrawals from areas\nwith water stress are about the same or higher. In this example, the response to\ncolumn 3 \u201cComparison with previous reporting year\u201d would be \u201clower\u201d although their\nabsolute withdrawals from areas with water stress have not been reduced.\nPrimary reason for comparison with previous reporting year / Primary reason for forecast (columns\n4, 6)\n\u2022 Select the most significant reason.\n\u2022 \u201cMaximum potential volume reduction already achieved\u201d refers to situations where\nwater saving limits have been reached \u2013 for example where a closed-loop water\nrecycling system has been put in place and further water reductions are not feasible.\n% of total withdrawals that are withdrawn from areas with water stress (column 7)\n\u2022 This column will be auto-calculated in the disclosure platform.\n\u2022 The % of total withdrawals from areas with water stress will be calculated using the\nvolume withdrawn from areas with water stress figure (column 2) and the volume of\ntotal withdrawals figure given in 9.2.2 (column 1, row 1).

For example, withdrawing water\nfrom an overdrawn aquifer will have different consequences for local water stress and a\ncompany\u2019s water security than does withdrawing seawater. Clean freshwater is becoming\nincreasingly scarce, and this can impact production processes that rely on large volumes of\nwater.\nIn regions where water sources are highly restricted, the organization\u2019s water consumption\npatterns can also influence relations with other stakeholders.\nResponse options P lease complete the following table:\n0 1 2 3 4 5\n184\n\nComparison with Primary reason for\nVolume\nSource Relevance previous reporting comparison with Please explain\n(megaliters/year)\nyear previous reporting year\nFresh surface water, Select from: Numerical field [enter a Select from: Select from: Text field\nincluding rainwater, \u2022 Relevant number from 0- \u2022 Much lower \u2022 Change in [maximum 1,000\nwater from wetlands, \u2022 Relevant but 999,999,999,999 using \u2022 Lower accounting characters]\nrivers, and lakes volume a maximum of 2 \u2022 About the same methodology\nunknown decimal places] \u2022 Higher \u2022 Divestment from\n\u2022 Not relevant \u2022 Much higher water intensive\n\u2022 This is our first technology/process\nyear of \u2022 Facility closure\nmeasurement \u2022 Facility expansion\n\u2022 Increase/decrease in\nbusiness activity\n\u2022 Increase/decrease in\nefficiency\n\u2022 Investment in water-\nsmart\ntechnology/process\n\u2022 Maximum potential\nvolume reduction\nalready achieved\n\u2022 Mergers and\nacquisitions\n\u2022 Unknown\n\u2022 Other, please\nspecify\nBrackish surface\nwater/Seawater\nGroundwater \u2013\nrenewable\nGroundwater \u2013 non-\nrenewable\nProduced/Entrained\nwater\nThird party sources\n[Fixed row]\nRequested content Note: Organizations responding to an electric utilities, metals & mining, or coal sector request\nshould refer to additional sector-specific guidance on this question at the end of the \"Requested\ncontent\u201d section.\nGeneral\n\u2022 For the different sources, this question is requesting a figure for aggregated withdrawal\nvolumes from across your organization. Information about your withdrawals by their\nsource allows a better understanding of your company\u2019s dependency on different\nsources, the trend in that dependency, and your risk exposure from different water\nsources. If you do not have aggregated company-wide volumetric data, you may\nprovide an estimate and give an explanation in column 5 (Please explain).\n\u2022 Cooling water: Cooling water (freshwater or sea water) is often withdrawn in large\nquantities and discharged back to its original source with negligible losses or variation\nin quality. However, this should be included in your water accounts. For example, a\nutility company may use large volumes of surface water for cooling purposes, and the\nwater quality may not need to be fresh. Companies should report this information by\n185\n\nselecting \u2018Brackish surface water/seawater\u2019, to demonstrate to investors that they are\nnot dependent on potentially scarce fresh surface water sources and therefore their\nrisk exposure is likely to be less than if they were dependent on freshwater resources.\n\u2022 Rainwater: If a company is managing rainwater (for example, by harvesting for use or\nstorage, or to prevent flooding) or is dependent on it for production of goods or the\ndelivery of services, it should try to estimate and disclose it as a withdrawal from the\nhydrological system into the company boundary.\no Companies may choose to exclude collected rainwater and domestic sewage\nfrom their water withdrawal/discharge volumes only if this would result in less\nthan 5% error in their water balance.\no Including rainwater helps companies better understand their water\ndependency and risks. For some companies, precipitation/rainwater volumes\nmay constitute a principal input of water at site level. In these cases, excluding\nrainwater from water accounting \u2013 withdrawal and discharge - would not be a\ntrue reflection of site water balance. In addition, there may be reduced impacts\nfrom using rainwater in place of other local freshwater sources.\n\u2022 Oil & gas sector only: Groundwater - As part of groundwater withdrawal volumes (be it\nfrom renewable or non-renewable sources), organizations should include all\nwithdrawals from aquifers (other than the formation being exploited). These\nwithdrawals may be intended for any use in the organization, including injection to\nmaintain well pressure or as part of the fracture fluids.\nSource (column 0)\n\u2022 Fresh surface water: For the purposes of this disclosure you should include all surface\nwater sources of a higher quality than brackish (i.e. a TDS lower than 10,000 mg/l).\nRelevance (column 1)\nSelect:\n\u2022 \u2018Relevant\u2019 if your company uses, has used or plans to use the source, even if the\nwithdrawal is zero for this reporting year.\n\u2022 \u2018Relevant but volume unknown\u2019 if your company uses, has used or plans to use the\nsource, but the volume for this year is unknown and cannot be estimated. Columns 2, 3\nand 4 will then be disabled and you should provide further explanation in column 5\n(Please explain).\n\u2022 \u2018Not relevant\u2019 if your company does not withdraw from the source. Columns 2, 3 and 4\nwill then be disabled. You may provide further explanation in column 5 (Please explain).\nVolume (megaliters/year) (column 2)\n\u2022 Volumes should be reported in megaliters per year (1 megaliter = 1 million liters or\n1000 m3). Your reporting year is the time period you stated in response to question\n1.4.\n\u2022 If you do have volumetric data for the current reporting year you may provide an\nestimate and explain why this is the case in column 5.\n\u2022 Note that a zero (0) should only be used for reporting zero volumes and not for an\nabsence of data.\n\u2022 If reporting zero withdrawals, provide an explanation in column 5. Before deciding\nwhether your withdrawals should be reported as \u201czero\u201d, please refer to CDP\u2019s definition\nof water withdrawals.\nComparison with previous reporting year (column 3)\n\u2022 CDP does not define the threshold for considering a value as \u2018much higher\u2019 rather than\nsimply \u2018higher\u2019 (or \u2018much lower\u2019/\u2019lower\u2019). CDP requests this information from many\ndifferent industries with huge variations in water use, and it would therefore be difficult\n186\n\nto provide a universal threshold that is meaningful (as proportions will equate to\ndifferent absolute values and impacts).\n\u2022 CDP recommends that you define your own threshold for what is \u2018much higher\u2019 (and\n\u2018much lower\u2019) and apply it consistently so that each year the reported data for this\nquestion is comparable and data users can track your water accounts more effectively.\nA company-specific explanation for these thresholds should be provided in column 5\nfor each source.\n\u2022 If the data was not previously reported, but was collected, you may choose to indicate a\ncomparison with the previous year or select \"This is our first year of measurement\". In\neither case, use the \u201cPlease explain\u201d column to provide details about the information\nreported.\nPrimary reason for comparison with previous reporting year (column 4)\n\u2022 Select the most significant reason for the comparison with previous reporting year.\no \u2018Maximum potential volume reduction already achieved\u2019 refers to situations\nwhere water saving limits have been reached \u2013 for example where a closed-\nloop water recycling system has been put in place and further water reductions\nare not feasible.\nPlease explain (column 5)\n\u2022 To assist CDP data users to understand a company\u2019s water use, you should explain\nyour selections for \u2018Relevance\u2019 (column 1) and \u2018Primary reason for comparison with\nprevious reporting year\u2019 (column 4), including any company-specific contextual\ninformation.\n\u2022 Report whether your volumes for each source are estimated, modelled, or sourced from\ndirect measurements. If estimation or modelling has been used, report the estimation\nor modelling methods.\n\u2022 Please explain any zero volumes for relevant sources. For example, \u201cwe sometimes\nwithdraw water from this source but the volume for the reporting year was zero\u201d.\n\u2022 Describe the thresholds for what is \u2018much higher\u2019 and \u2018much lower\u2019 for the change in\nvolumes compared to the previous reporting year.\n\u2022 Indicate the anticipated future trends for these volumes, if known (note that future\ntrends would be at least one year after the end of the reporting year provided in 1.4).\n\u2022 For \u201cFresh surface water\u201d (row 1), it is important that you state which of the sources\napply (rainwater, water from wetlands, rivers and lakes etc.). Also state whether those\nsources are monitored and if you know whether the withdrawal volume for each source\nis increasing or decreasing. If you are using and managing rainwater and the volume\nequates to more than 5% of your water balance, please explain if it is harvested, treated\netc. and the benefits and impacts of using it.\n\u2022 For \u2018Third party\u2019 (row 6), if possible, specify whether the third party is a municipal\nsupplier or another type of third party organization. This is particularly important if the\nthird party is known to be located in a water stressed area.\nRequested content \u2013 Sector-specific guidance for electric utilities sector\nSector-specific\nGeneral\n\u2022 This guidance is specific to companies responding to an electric utilities sector request.\nYou should first read the guidance for this question that applies to all companies. This\nis additional to the general guidance and does not replace it.\n\u2022 CDP recognizes the difficulty in accounting for some elements of the hydropower\noperations\u2019 water balance, specifically surface runoff or elements that are outside the\norganization\u2019s control such as third-party discharges into the reservoir (for example a\nmunicipal waste water treatment plant discharging into the reservoir).\n187\n\n\u2022 Water withdrawals into hydropower operations include river inflow, surface runoff and\nprecipitation onto the reservoir surface, as well as third-party discharges into the\nreservoir:\nW = Precipitation + River Inflow + Runoff + Third-party discharges into reservoir\n\u2022 Organizations should strive to include volumes for those sources if they would result in\nan estimated error in their water balance of more than 5% (specifically the total water\nwithdrawals figure you report in 9.2.2) and take a consistent approach throughout the\nquestionnaire. In the last column (Please explain) you should indicate which sources\nyou have included or excluded. Note that estimation or modelling are valid sources of\ndata.\nRelevance (column 1)\n\u2022 For your hydropower operations - if the data for third-party discharges to the reservoir\nor the surface runoff volumes are not available, you may select \u201cRelevant but volume\nunknown\u201d or \u201cNot relevant\u201d depending on which best applies to your organization. You\nmay consider water volumes to be relevant if the resulting error in the organization\u2019s\nwater balance would be more than 5%.\nPlease explain (column 5)\n\u2022 Indicate which elements of water withdrawals (river inflow, surface runoff, precipitation\nonto the reservoir surface or third-party discharges into the reservoir), are you taking\ninto account when providing your response, as well as the method followed to obtain it,\ne.g. direct monitoring, estimation from a hydrological model, or other secondary source\nof information.\nSector-specific guidance for metals & mining and coal sectors\nGeneral\n\u2022 This guidance is specific to companies responding to a metals & mining or coal sector\nrequest. You should first read the guidance for this question that applies to all\ncompanies. This is additional to the general guidance and does not replace it.\nSource (column 0)\n\u2022 Rainwater: Please note that in the mining industry precipitation/rainwater volumes\nmay constitute a principal input of water at site level. Excluding rainwater from water\naccounting would not be a true reflection of site water balance.\n\u2022 Groundwater: Groundwater withdrawals are linked to extraction from bore holes and\naquifer interception, i.e. groundwater is water that is extracted as part of ore body\ndewatering during mining operations. Water entrained in ore should be reported as\nproduced water.\n\u2022 Brackish water/seawater: Organizations sourcing freshwater of low water quality\n(categories 2 and 3 of the Water Accounting Framework from the Mineral Council of\nAustralia) and using it in their operations without significant treatment may report these\nresources as part of row 3 \u201cBrackish water/seawater\u201d sources, despite being a different\ntype of resource.\n\u2022 Produced/Entrained water: Water entrained in ore should be reported in this row.\nPlease explain (column 5)\n\u2022 You may provide additional information to describe your organization\u2019s water use.\nConsider providing an explanation of factors like local landscape, geology, climate or\nhydrogeology, commodity type, or ore grade.\n188\n\nExplanation of terms \u2022 Brackish surface water/seawater: Surface water in which the concentration of salts is\nhigh and far exceeds normally acceptable standards for municipal, domestic or\nirrigation use (at least higher than 10,000 mg/l TDS). Seawater has a typical\nconcentration of salts above 35,000 mg/l TDS.\n\u2022 Fresh surface water, including rainwater, water from wetlands, rivers and lakes:\nWater that is naturally occurring water on the Earth's surface in ice sheets, ice caps,\nglaciers, icebergs, bogs, ponds, lakes, rivers and streams, and has a low concentration\nof dissolved solids. For the purposes of reporting water accounting data to CDP, this\nsurface water source includes water of a quality generally acceptable for, or requiring\nminimal treatment to be acceptable for, domestic, municipal or agricultural uses (at\nleast <10,000 mg/l TDS, though a range of additional quality properties may also be\nconsidered). \u2018High quality\u2019 fresh water sources considered acceptable for potable use\nare typically characterized as having concentrations of dissolved solids less than 1,000\nmg/l.\n\u2022 Groundwater (non-renewable): Water which is being held in, and can be recovered\nfrom, an underground formation. Non-renewable groundwater has a negligible rate of\nnatural recharge on the human time-scale (more than 50 years), and is generally\nlocated at deeper depths than renewable groundwater. This is sometimes referred to\nas \u201cfossil\u201d water.\n\u2022 Groundwater (renewable): Water which is being held in, and can be recovered from, an\nunderground formation. Renewable groundwater sources can be replenished within 50\nyears and are usually located at shallow depths.\n\u2022 Produced water: Water which enters the organization\u2019s boundary as a result of the\nextraction, processing, or use of any raw material, so that it must be managed by the\norganization. When reporting to CDP, this water should not be counted as recycled\nwater when put to use within a single cycle of a business process. Examples of\nproduced water include moisture derived from vegetation such as in sugar cane\ncrushing and the water content in crude oil. (Note that companies with oil and gas\nactivities should refer to CDP\u2019s sector specific guidance for this water aspect).\n\u2022 Produced water (Oil & gas sector only): water that is brought to the surface during the\nproduction of hydrocarbons including formation water, flow-back water and\ncondensation water (IPIECA \u201cOil and gas industry guidance on voluntary sustainability\nreporting\u201d, 4th edition, 2020\n\u2022 Third party sources: This includes water provided by municipal water suppliers, public\nor private utilities, and wastewater from any other organization.\n\u2022 Water withdrawal: The sum of all water drawn into the boundaries of the organization\nfrom all sources for any use over the course of the reporting period.\nTags\nAuthority Type All requesters\nEnvironmental Question level W only\nIssue (Theme)\nQuestionnaire Question level All (except FS)\nSector\nDischarges by destination",

If you do not have aggregated company-wide volumetric data, you\nmay provide an estimate and give an explanation in column 5 (Please explain).\n190\n\n\u2022 Zero discharge permit: If your company has a zero discharge permit, please consider\nany discharges that may exist outside this permit and may still be relevant to CDP\u2019s\ndefinition of discharges.\n\u2022 Rainwater: Rainwater/run-off that enters the site/facility boundary and is captured\ncould also be counted as an output or discharge (even if not used in operations) if\nreturned to the water environment via a dedicated discharge destination; e.g. river or\ngroundwater via soakaway/filtration pond. You may choose to exclude collected\nrainwater from your discharge accounting, unless this would result in an error in your\nbalance of more than 5%.\no Note that in the mining industry precipitation/rainwater volumes may\nconstitute a principal input of water at site level and excluding rainwater\nwould not be a true reflection of their site water balance. Companies in this\nsector (and others to which this is relevant) should report rainwater/runoff\ndrawn into the boundaries of their operations and then discharged and\nexplain this in column 5.\n\u2022 Cooling water: Cooling water (freshwater or sea water) is often withdrawn in large\nquantities and discharged back to its original source with negligible losses or variation in\nquality. However, this should be included in your water accounts.\n\u2022 Domestic sources: Domestic sewage is not regarded as water discharge. However, if\nwastewater comes from domestic sources but is pre-dominantly generated from sector\nbusiness activities e.g. healthcare residential properties, this should be reported if it\nwould result in an error in your balance of more than 5%.\n\u2022 Aquifer reinjection: reinjection to aquifers should be considered as a discharge to\ngroundwater.\n\u2022 Soakaway: Water returning to a groundwater source via a soakaway should be\nconsidered as a discharge.\n\u2022 Groundwater (oil & gas sector only): In oil production, as part of secondary and tertiary\nrecovery operations, water-based fluids (from various sources) may be used to maintain\nthe pressure, and to displace the hydrocarbons and move them towards the production\nwells. For CDP disclosure, organizations must report these volumes as discharges to\ngroundwater bodies, to enable comparability and have an accurate water balance.\nRelevance (column 1)\n\u2022 Select:\no \u2018Relevant\u2019 if your company uses, has used or plans to use the source, even if\nthe discharge is zero for this reporting year.\no \u2018Relevant but volume unknown\u2019 if your company uses, has used or plans to\nuse the source, but the volume for this year is unknown.

You should provide further\nexplanation in column 5 (Please explain).\nVolume (megaliters/year) (column 2)\n\u2022 Volumes should be reported in megaliters per year (1 megaliter = 1 million liters or 1000\nm3). Your reporting year is the time period you stated in response to question 1.4.\n\u2022 If you do have volumetric data for the current reporting year you may provide an\nestimate and explain why this is the case in column 5.\n191\n\n\u2022 Note that a zero should only be used for reporting zero volumes and not for an absence\nof data.\n\u2022 If reporting zero discharges, provide an explanation in column 5.\n\u2022 Before deciding whether your discharges should be reported as \u201czero\u201d, please refer to\nCDP\u2019s definition of water discharges. This may be the case, for example, if a closed\nwater circuit, or zero liquid effluent discharge complex, is in operation and a facility does\nnot discharge water as all water is reused by the operation(s) during\nprocessing/production.\nComparison with previous reporting year (column 3)\n\u2022 CDP does not define the threshold for considering a value as \u2018much higher\u2019 rather than\nsimply \u2018higher\u2019 (or \u2018much lower\u2019/\u2019lower\u2019). CDP requests this information from many\ndifferent industries with huge variations in water use, and it would therefore be difficult\nto provide a universal threshold that is meaningful (as proportions will equate to\ndifferent absolute values and impacts).\n\u2022 CDP recommends that you define your own threshold for what is \u2018much higher\u2019 (and\n\u2018much lower\u2019) and apply it consistently so that each year the reported data for this\nquestion is comparable and data users can track your water accounts more effectively.\nA company-specific explanation for these thresholds should be provided in column 5 for\neach destination.\n\u2022 If the data was not previously reported, but was collected, you may choose to indicate a\ncomparison with the previous year or select \"This is our first year of measurement\". In\neither case, use the \u201cPlease explain\u201d column to provide details about the information\nreported.\nPrimary reason for comparison with previous reporting year (column 4)\n\u2022 Select the most significant reason for the comparison with previous reporting year.\n\u2022 \u2018Maximum potential volume reduction already achieved\u2019 refers to situations where\nwater saving limits have been reached \u2013 for example where a closed-loop water\nrecycling system has been put in place and further water reductions are not feasible.\nPlease explain (column 5)\n\u2022 To assist CDP data users to understand a company\u2019s water use, you should explain your\nselections for \u2018Relevance\u2019 (column 1) and \u2018Primary reason for comparison with previous\nreporting year\u2019 (column 4), including any company-specific contextual information.\n\u2022 Report whether your volumes for each destination are estimated, modelled, or sourced\nfrom direct measurements. If estimation or modelling has been used, report the\nestimation or modelling methods.\n\u2022 To give data users confidence in your response, please explain any zero volumes for\nrelevant destinations; e.g. if a completely closed loop cooling system has been\nintroduced. Remember to report any discharged water that exceeds site storage\ncapacity, e.g. excessive rainfall, as a separate discharge.\n\u2022 Describe the thresholds for what is \u2018much higher\u2019 and \u2018much lower\u2019 for the change in\nvolumes compared to the previous reporting year.\n\u2022 Indicate the anticipated future trends for these volumes, if known (note that future\ntrends would be at least one year after the end of the reporting year provided in 1.4).\n\u2022 For discharges to a Third-party, it is important to state if this includes water supplied to\nother organizations for their use.\n192\n\nRequested content \u2013 Sector-specific guidance for electric utilities sector\nSector specific\nGeneral\n\u2022 This guidance is specific to companies responding to an electric utilities sector request.\nYou should first read the guidance for this question that applies to all companies. This is\nadditional to the general guidance and does not replace it.\n\u2022 CDP recognizes the difficulty in accounting for some elements of the hydropower\noperations\u2019 water balance, specifically seepage or those that are outside the\norganization\u2019s control such as third-party withdrawals.\n\u2022 In hydropower operations, water discharge includes the dam outlet and the spillway,\nunderground seepage and third-party withdrawals from the reservoir (for example a\nmunicipal water plant abstracting from the reservoir):\nD = Dam outlet + Spillway + Seepage + Third-party withdrawals from the reservoir\n\u2022 Organizations should strive to include volumes for those destinations if they would\nresult in an estimated error in their water balance of more than 5% (specifically the total\ndischarge figure you report in 9.2.2) and take a consistent approach throughout the\nquestionnaire. In the last column (Please explain), you should explain which destinations\nyou have included or excluded. Note that estimation or modelling are valid sources of\ndata.\nRelevance (column 1)\n\u2022 For your hydropower operations - if the data for third-party withdrawals from the\nreservoir or the seepage volumes are not available, you may select \u201cRelevant but volume\nunknown\u201d or \u201cNot relevant\u201d depending on which best applies to your organization. You\nmay consider water volumes to be relevant if the resulting error in the organization\u00b4s\nwater balance would be more than 5%.\nPlease explain (column 5)\n\u2022 For hydropower operations explain if any changes in the water discharge volumes are\nrelated to higher/lower electricity production or other reasons related to water resources\nmanagement such as flood control, satisfaction of downstream water demand, etc.\n\u2022 Indicate which elements of water discharges (dam outlet and spillway, seepage and\nthird-party withdrawals from the reservoir) you are taking into account when providing\nyour response.\nSector-specific guidance for metals & mining and coal sectors\nGeneral\n\u2022 This guidance is specific to companies responding to a metals & mining or coal sector\nrequest. You should first read the guidance for this question that applies to all\ncompanies. This is additional to the general guidance and does not replace it.\nDestination (column 0)\n\u2022 Brackish water/seawater: Discharges to brackish or seawater refer to the controlled\ndischarge to estuary or to sea discharge volumes. This aligns with the Water\nAccounting Framework from the Mineral Council of Australia.\n\u2022 Groundwater: Discharges to groundwater refer to seepage or aquifer reinjection\ndischarge volumes. This aligns with the Water Accounting Framework from the Mineral\nCouncil of Australia.\n193\n\nExplanation of terms \u2022 Brackish surface water/seawater: Surface water in which the concentration of salts is\nhigh and far exceeds normally acceptable standards for municipal, domestic or\nirrigation use (at least higher than 10,000 mg/l TDS). Seawater has a typical\nconcentration of salts above 35,000 mg/l TDS.\n\u2022 Fresh surface water, including wetlands, rivers and lakes: Water that is naturally\noccurring water on the Earth's surface and has a low concentration of dissolved\nsolids. For the purposes of reporting water accounting data to CDP, this surface water\nsource includes water of a quality generally acceptable for, or requiring minimal\ntreatment to be acceptable for, domestic, municipal or agricultural uses (at least\n<10,000 mg/l TDS, though a range of additional quality properties may also be\nconsidered). \u201cHigh quality\u201d fresh water sources considered acceptable for potable use\nare typically characterized as having concentrations of dissolved solids less than 1,000\nmg/l.\n\u2022 Discharges to groundwater: Discharge to groundwater, by human activity or natural\nactivity, refers to a destination beneath the soil surface, such as a water bearing layer of\nrock (aquifer). Examples of discharges to groundwater include disposal of sewage, trade\neffluent and surface water run-off from urban areas, through such methods as\nspreading basins, soakaways, swales or injection wells.\n\u2022 Third-party destinations: This includes municipal wastewater plants, public or private\nutilities, and other organizations involved in the transport, treatment, disposal or further\nuse of wastewater.\n\u2022 Note that to qualify as a third-party destination, \u201cother organizations\u201d using your\nwastewater must be outside your reporting boundary given in question 1.5.\n\u2022 Any of your wastewater that has been treated on your own site should be reported as\ndischarge according to its ultimate destination (for example, to groundwater), as this is\nwhere any potential risks for the company lie.\nWater discharge: The sum of effluents and other water leaving the boundaries of the\norganization (or facility) and released to surface water, groundwater, or third parties over\nthe course of the reporting period (adapted from GRI Standard 306-1, 2016).\nTags\nAuthority Type All requesters\nEnvironmental Question level W only\nIssue (Theme)\nQuestionnaire Question level All (except FS)\nSector\nDischarges by level(s) of treatment",

A preliminary treatment may\noften be applied involving the physical removal of large debris, large particles, oils, and\ngrease, typically through screens and grit chambers.\n\u2022 Secondary treatment: Secondary treatment involves the degradation of organic matter\nand reduction of solids through biological treatment. The removal of nutrients (nitrogen\nand/or phosphorus) can also be achieved at this level of treatment using a combination\nof chemical and biological treatments. Secondary treatment follows primary treatment.\n\u2022 Tertiary treatment: Tertiary treatment involves the additional treatment needed to\nremove suspended, colloidal and dissolved constituents (nutrients, heavy metals,\ninorganic and other contaminants) remaining after secondary treatment through a\nnumber of processes including granular media filtration, biological nitrification-\ndenitrification, biological phosphorus removal, chlorination, etc.. Tertiary treatment\nfollows secondary treatment.\nExample response (See table below) Note that the responses for each row reflect examples from different\ncompanies to demonstrate the relevance of different treatment levels to several business\ntypes.\n0 1 2 3 4\nHighest level of Relevance of Comparison of treated Primary reason for\nVolume\ntreatment within direct treatment level to volume with previous comparison with\n(megaliters/year)\noperations discharge reporting year previous reporting year\nTertiary treatment Relevant 29500.0 About the same Increase/decrease in\nefficiency\nSecondary treatment Relevant 11151.0 About the same Increase/decrease in\nbusiness activity\nPrimary treatment only Relevant 32175.0 About the same Facility closure\nDischarge to the natural Not relevant Question not Question not applicable Question not applicable\nenvironment without applicable\ntreatment\n198\n\nDischarge to a third party Relevant 25277.0 Lower Increase/decrease in\nwithout treatment business activity\nOther Relevant 5286.0 About the same Other, please specify: slight\nincrease in total\nprecipitation\n0 5 6\nHighest level of % of your\ntreatment within sites/facilities/operations Please explain\ndirect operations this volume applies to\nTertiary treatment 100% Relevant: At all our plants, we treat discharge to remove nitrogen and\nphosphorus, along with other dissolved inorganic substances through\ncoagulation, sedimentation, activated carbon absorption and ion\nexchange methods. Tertiary treatment was applied to 100% of our total\ndischarges this reporting year. All discharge volumes were subject to\nstrict water quality controls before being released to receiving water\nbodies.\nChange in volume: 29,980 megalitres were treated to tertiary level in the\nprevious year and 29,500 megalitres were treated to tertiary level this\nyear. Therefore, the volume has decreased by 480 megalitres (equivalent\nto a decrease of 1.6%). This decrease is due to reduced quantities of\ndomestic water use in some of our plants after implementing efficiency\nmeasures. Our definition of change: Much higher: >+10%, Higher: >+5%,\nAbout the same: <+/-5%, Lower: >-5%, Much lower: >-10%.\nAnticipated future trend: Discharge volumes treated to tertiary level are\nexpected to remain the same in the upcoming years as no significant\nalterations are being planned for the production processes.\nSecondary 100% Relevant: All discharge volumes were treated to secondary level this year.\ntreatment Discharge containing organic compounds is generated at our facilities\nthat clean and process natural rubber. We monitor water discharge\nquality (e.g., pH, BOD, COD, SS, harmful substances, etc.) based on\napplicable regulations by continuous real time monitoring or third-party\nsampling analysis at all of our facilities (mostly on a monthly basis). Our\nfacilities have implemented water effluent standards that meet or tighten\napplicable government standards.\nChange in volume: There has been a 69 megaliter increase in this volume\nfrom the previous year (equivalent to an increase of 0.62%). The\ndischarge volume treated to secondary level last reporting year was\n11,082 megaliters, and for the current reporting year it was 11,151\nmegaliters. This was due to a slight increase in production, resulting in\nhigher water withdrawals.\nOur definition for change: Much higher: >+10%, Higher: >+5%, About the\nsame: <+/-5%, Lower: >-5%, Much lower: >-10%.\nAnticipated future trend: it is expected that the volume of discharge (and\nthe volume treated to a secondary treatment level) will increase slightly in\nthe next few years due to increases in production, relating to COVID-19\nrecovery.\n199\n\nPrimary treatment 11-20 Relevant: 15% of the company's discharge is pre-treated to primary level\nonly before discharge to local treatment facilities under municipal discharge\npermits. Primary treatment of manufacturing and R&D discharge varies\ndepending on the characteristics of the sub-operation's discharge, and\nmay include pH adjustment, flocculation, sedimentation and filtration.\nChange in volume: This treatment accounted for 15% of total discharges\nthis year, a decrease of 2% from last year given one of our plants idled\nand later sold.\nOur definition of change: About the same: <4%, Lower/Higher: <8%, Much\nlower/higher: >8%. This threshold is also used for the future trend.\nAnticipated future trend: Given that our company has a target to reduce\nprocess water use / tonne by 30% between 2020 and 2030, it is expected\nthat the discharge volumes requiring treatment will sightly decrease due\nto more efficient water use.\nDischarge to the Question not applicable Not relevant: In all our plants, discharge is not released to the natural\nnatural environment without treatment. Water volumes are discharged either\nenvironment without after on-site treatment/purification or after treatment by a third party.\ntreatment\nDischarge to a third 71-80 Relevant: In our sites, water is primarily used for cooling molds. In\nparty without addition, water is used for drinking water and sanitation/hygiene\ntreatment services. These volumes are discharged to a third party without\ntreatment.\nChange in volume: The discharge volume (25,277 megaliters) in the\nreporting year is slightly lower than the previous year (26,350 megaliters)\ndue to the COVID-19 crisis which resulted in lower production.\nOur definition for change: Much higher: >+10%, Higher: >+5%, About the\nsame: <+/-5%, Lower: >-5%, Much lower: >-10%.\nAnticipated future trend: The discharge volume is expected to increase\ndue to post COVID-19 market expectations (growth).\nTreatment applied by third party: The third party (municipal sewage\ntreatment plant) applies a conventional secondary treatment, and the\ntreatment plant publicly states compliance with local water regulations.\nOther Less than 1% Relevant: Some of our sites treat high-quality surface runoff volumes\n(predominantly stormwater) utilizing natural filtration zones such as\nwetlands, rather than processing through a wastewater treatment plant.\nMonitoring of these discharges for potential pollutants occurs.\nChange in volume: The discharge volume (5,286 megaliters) in the\nreporting year increased by about 3% from the previous year (5,120\nmegaliters) due to a slight increase in total precipitation over the\nreporting year.\nOur definition for change: About the same is within +/- <5%, Lower or\nHigher +/- 5% to 9%, and Much lower or Much higher +/- >10%.\n200\n\nAnticipated future trend: This volume depends largely on precipitation\nand other weather patterns. The volume may be larger or smaller\ndepending on the amount of precipitation received and the resulting\nstormwater runoff.\nTags\nAuthority Type All requesters\nEnvironmental Question level W only\nIssue (Theme)\nQuestionnaire Question level All (except FS)\nSector\nEmissions to water",

Do not count local dependencies,\nimpacts, risks and/or opportunities unless they are substantive for the organization as\na whole.\n\u2022 Note that you are requested to disclose inherent dependencies, impacts, risks and/or\nopportunities \u2013 so include those that your organization is exposed to prior to the\nimplementation of any response strategies.\n\u2022 Facilities where opportunities have been identified should only be included where the\nfacility has also been identified to have water-related dependencies, impacts and/or\nrisks.\n\u2022 Facilities disclosed in this question may be situated within or near the priority\nlocations reported in 2.3.\nIdentification of facilities in the value chain stage (column 1)\n\u2022 The options in this column are driven by your selections in 2.2. Options \u201cYes, we have\nassessed this value chain stage and identified facilities with substantive water-related\ndependencies, impacts, risks, and/or opportunities\u201d and \u201cNo, we have assessed this\nvalue chain stage but did not identify facilities with substantive water-related\ndependencies, impacts, risks, and/or opportunities\u201d will only appear if \u201cYes\u201d is selected\nin column 1 of 2.2.\nTotal number of facilities identified (column 2)\n204\n\n\u2022 The definition of facility may vary between organizations or sectors. See the\nExplanation of terms for more information.\n\u2022 You may aggregate facilities. For example, a hotel chain may wish to group hotels by\ngrade or resort type. Rather than assess each of its 20 hotels individually it may be\nmore appropriate to combine 20 hotels within the same river basin into one \u201cfacility\u201d.\nThe organization can then assess this against its threshold for substantive effect on\nthe organization as described in 2.4.\n\u2022 Note the following on the aggregation of facilities:\no Due to the local nature of water dependencies, impacts, risks, and\nopportunities, only facilities in the same river basin and the same jurisdiction\nmay be aggregated. In the case of very large river basins, facilities in a single\nbasin may face different regulatory as well as local physical risks so that\naggregation would obscure an understanding of the organization's water\ndependency and risk exposure in the region.\no - Organizations should consider aggregating facilities within a river basin if the\ndependencies, impacts, risks and/or opportunities of a single local facility are\nnot substantive but would be substantive in aggregate with other similar local\nfacilities. For example, a single factory with low water use may not have a\nsubstantive dependency on a river. However, when aggregated together with\nother local facilities, the cumulative effect on the river basin could be\nsubstantial.\no Aggregation of facilities should not be used where information on the risk\nexposure, or water accounting data, of the single facility would be meaningful\nand specific to that facility.\n\u2022 There is a limit of 1,000 on the total number of facilities that you may report as having\ndependencies, impacts, risks and or/opportunities. This is because you should only count\nfacilities, or groups of facilities, that expose your organization to substantive\ndependencies, impacts, risks and/or opportunities according to your definition in 2.4. If\nyou have more than 1,000 it may be that your definition of substantive effects on your\norganization in 2.4 is extreme.

For example, you may wish to give a general, organization-\nspecific comment on the nature, severity and location of the corporate-level\ndependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities that your organization is exposed to,\nwhether they result from any particular business activity, and the relationship between\nthe inherent risk and your residual risk exposure. You may have reported that 60% of\nyour facilities are exposed to inherent risks due to their location, but this represents\nonly 30% of your total output and the residual risk has been much reduced due to the\nintroduction of new controls.

In regions where water sources are highly restricted, the\norganization's water consumption patterns can influence relations with other stakeholders.\nProviding facility-level information is useful for demonstrating regulatory compliance (e.g.,\ndischarges to the local environment), for risk assessments and for providing insight to risk\nresponses (e.g., tracking water efficiency improvements).\nGeo-location coordinates for your facilities with substantive water-related dependencies,\nimpacts, risks, and/or opportunities enables data users to analyze geographically linked\ndependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities and to do so across multiple companies.\nThis also facilitates the integration of CDP\u2019s water data with other geographically linked data.\nResponse options Please complete the following table.

The\ntable has a maximum of 100 rows. If your organization has over 100 facilities with\nsubstantive water-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and/or opportunities, report\nthe 100 facilities with the highest levels of dependencies, impacts, risks, or\nopportunities. This may be based on facilities located in areas with water stress,\nfacilities with the highest risk exposure, or other factors.\n\u2022 The data reported in this question should be based on the relevant facility boundary\n(see Explanations of terms).\n\u2022 The appearance of columns in this question is driven by your selection in column 3\n\u201cValue chain stage\u201d and column 5 \u201cWithdrawals or discharges in the reporting year\u201d.\n\u2022 Only report Tier 1 supplier facilities if relevant to your selection in column 3 \u201cValue\nchain stage\u201d.\n\u2022 Report volumetric data in megaliters per year for the reporting year you stated in\nresponse to 1.4. (1 megaliter = 1 million liters or 1000 m3).\n\u2022 If estimating or extrapolating to provide complete coverage, give an explanation in\ncolumn 29 \u201cPlease explain\u201d. Remember that a zero should only be used for reporting\nzero volumes and not for an absence of data.\n\u2022 If you do not have a figure for any of the facilities you disclose here, you may\nprovide an estimate. Explain this in column \u201cPlease explain\u201d. For withdrawals, data\nmay be collected from several sources, including water meters, water bills,\ncalculations derived from other available water data or the organization\u2019s own\nestimates if neither water meters nor bills or reference data exist.\n\u2022 Cooling water: Cooling water (freshwater or sea water) is often withdrawn in large\nquantities and discharged back to its original source with negligible losses or\nvariation in quality. However, this volume should be included in your water\naccounts.\n\u2022 Rainwater: If a company is managing rainwater (for example, by harvesting for use\nor storage, or to prevent flooding), or is dependent on it for production of goods or\nthe delivery of services, it should try to estimate and disclose it as a withdrawal\nfrom the hydrological system into the company boundary. Note that in some\njurisdictions rainwater is considered a withdrawal source and organizations are\nrequired to report its collection and use.\no Companies may choose to exclude collected rainwater and domestic\nsewage from their water withdrawal/discharge volumes only if the resulting\nerror in their water balance would be less than 5%. This avoids your\ndischarge volumes being larger than your withdrawals.\no Including rainwater helps companies better understand their water\ndependency and risks. For some companies, precipitation/rainwater\nvolumes may constitute a principal input of water at site level. This includes\nrun-off where it must be managed. In these cases, excluding rainwater from\n211\n\nwater accounting \u2013 withdrawal and discharge - would not be a true\nreflection of site water balance. In addition, there may be reduced impacts\nfrom using rainwater in place of other local freshwater sources.\nFacility reference number (column 1)\n\u2022 This CDP facility reference number is used to track information related to the same\nfacility in subsequent questions. It is not specific to your organization, however it does\nprevent you from having to repeat contextual information e.g., river basin and facility\nname.\nFacility name (column 2)\n\u2022 You may use the text box to provide a name for the facility to ease reporting and\nanalysis. The same facility name should be used throughout the questionnaire\nValue chain stage (column 3)\n\u2022 Indicate in which stages of your value chain the facility or facilities with substantive\nwater-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and/or opportunities are located.\n\u2022 If \u201cDirect operations\u201d is selected, all following columns will be presented.\n\u2022 If \u201cUpstream value chain\u201d is selected, columns 15-20 and 23-26 will not be\npresented.\n\u2022 Note: the presentation of the columns specified above will also depend on your\nselection in column 5 \u201cWithdrawals or discharges in the reporting year\u201d.\nWithdrawals or discharges in the reporting year (column 5)\n\u2022 Select any \u201cYes\u201d option if the facility has withdrawals and/or discharges.\n\u2022 Select \u201cNo\u201d if there are no withdrawals and discharges by this facility.\n\u2022 If either \u201cNo\u201d or \u201cYes, withdrawals only\u201d is selected, columns 21-26 will not be\npresented.\n\u2022 If either \u201cNo\u201d or \u201cYes, discharges only\u201d is selected, columns 13-20 will not be\npresented.\n\u2022 Note: the presentation of the columns specified above will also depend on your\nselection in column 3 \u201cValue chain stage\u201d.\n\u2022 If the facility has withdrawals or discharges, but you do not have figures for this\ndata, you may provide an estimate and explain in the last column \u201cPlease explain\u201d.\nReason for no withdrawals and/or discharges (column 6)\n\u2022 This column will only be presented if \u201cYes, withdrawals only\u201d, \u201cYes, discharges only\u201d\nor \u201cNo\u201d is selected in column 5 \u201cWithdrawals or discharges in the reporting year\u201d.\n\u2022 Explain why the facility has substantive water-related dependencies, impacts, risks,\nand/or opportunities with no withdrawals and/or discharges.\n\u2022 If your organization has both zero withdrawals and discharges, clearly indicate the\nreason for each.\nCountry/Area & River basin (column 7)\n\u2022 From the drop-down options provided, select the river basin where the facility is\nlocated.

Refer to the\nguidance for 9.2.4 for more details.\n\u2022 As good practice, a water-stressed area should be measured at the catchment level\nas a minimum.\n\u2022 Commonly accepted global indicators to assess areas as water stressed and their\nthresholds for reporting to CDP include:\no Water availability \u2013 category greater than \u2018High risk\u2019: 3.4 (WWF Water Risk\nFilter). WWF recommends that users also take into consideration \u2018Medium\nrisk\u2019: >2.6.\n\u00a7 The WWF Water Risk Filter\u2019s risk category \u2018Water Availability\u2019\nintegrates the State of Nature layer for Water Availability\nrecommended for the Science-based Targets for Nature (SBTN)\nStep 1: Assess and Step 2: Interpret & Prioritize. The SBTN\u2019s State of\nNature layer for Water Availability is calculated based on a multi-\nmodel approach which integrates the best available global water\nscarcity risk indicators: Water depletion, Baseline water stress, and\nBlue water scarcity. In addition, WWF has incorporated an indicator\non groundwater availability in the WWF Water Risk Filter\u2019s risk\ncategory \u2018Water Availability\u2019.\n\u00a7 WWF recommends using the \u2018Drought\u2019 risk category as\nsupplementary information to help in interpreting results and\nprioritizing sites in water stressed areas, as droughts can\nexacerbate water stress/water availability.\n213\n\no Baseline water stress \u2013 indicator equal to/greater than \u2018High\u2019: 40-80%\n(WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas). This refers to the ratio of total annual\nwater withdrawals to available renewable water supply.\no Baseline water depletion \u2013 indicator equal to/greater than \u2018High\u2019: 50-75%\n(WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas). This refers to the ratio of total annual\nwater consumption to available renewable water supply.\nComparison with previous reporting year (columns 14, 22, 28)\n\u2022 CDP does not define the threshold for considering a value as \u201cmuch higher\u201d rather\nthan simply \u201chigher\u201d or \u201cmuch lower\u201d/\u201clower\u201d. CDP requests this information from\nmany different industries with huge variations in water use, and it would therefore\nbe difficult to provide a universal threshold that is meaningful as proportions will\nequate to different absolute values and impacts.\n\u2022 You should define your own threshold for what is \u201cmuch higher\u201d and \u201cmuch lower\u201d\nand apply it consistently so that each year the reported data for this question is\ncomparable and data users can track your water accounts more effectively. A\ncompany-specific explanation for these thresholds should be provided in column\n\"Please explain\".\n\u2022 If your response is an estimate, please explain why in column \u201cPlease explain\u201d.\n\u2022 If the data was not previously reported, but was collected, you may choose to\nindicate a comparison with the previous reporting year or select \"This is our first\nyear of measurement\". In either case, use the \u201cPlease explain\u201d column to provide\ndetails about the information reported.\nWithdrawals from fresh surface water, including rainwater, water from wetlands, rivers, and lakes\n(column 15)\n\u2022 This column is only presented if \u201cDirect operations\u201d is selected in column 3 and \u201cYes,\nwithdrawals and discharges\u201d or \u201cYes, withdrawals only\u201d are selected in column 5\n\u201cWithdrawals or discharges in the reporting year\u201d.\n\u2022 For the purposes of this disclosure you should include all surface water sources of\na higher quality than brackish i.e., a TDS lower than 10,000 mg/l.\nTotal water discharges at this facility (megaliters) (column 21)\n\u2022 This column is only presented if \u201cYes, withdrawals and discharges\u201d or \u201cYes,\ndischarges only\u201d are selected in column 5 \u201cWithdrawals or discharges in the\nreporting year\u201d.\n\u2022 Zero discharge permit: If your organization has a zero discharge permit, please\nconsider any discharges that may exist outside this permit and may still be relevant\nto CDP\u2019s definition of discharges.\n\u2022 Domestic sewage: Domestic sewage is only regarded as water discharge if\nexcluding it would result in an error in your balance of more than 5%. This may be\nsignificant for healthcare residential properties or hotels, for example.\n\u2022 Aquifer reinjection: Reinjection to aquifers should be considered as a discharge to\ngroundwater.\n\u2022 Soakaway: Water returning to a groundwater source via a soakaway should be\nconsidered as a discharge.\nPlease explain (column 29)\n\u2022 If the facility is an aggregate of multiple locations, explain how your methodology\nfor aggregating facilities was applied here.\n\u2022 To assist CDP data users to understand a facility\u2019s water use:\n214\n\no Explain the volumetric data and trends that you report for withdrawals,\ndischarges and consumption and include organization-specific information.\no Explain the dependencies, impacts, risks, and/or opportunities identified at\nthe facility and actions and initiatives to address these (e.g., collective\naction, Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) certification).\n\u2022 Indicate the thresholds for what is \u201cmuch higher\u201d and \u201cmuch lower\u201d for the change\nin volume for each water aspect compared to the previous year. You should\naccount for the change compared to last year and indicate the anticipated future\ntrends for these volumes if known. Note that future trends should be at least one\nyear after the end of the reporting year provided in 1.4.\n\u2022 Report whether your volumes for each facility are estimated, modelled, or sourced\nfrom direct measurements.\no If estimation or modelling has been used, report the estimation or modelling\nmethods.\no If there is any level of uncertainty in your response, or if there is an\nestimated figure, you should explain it in this field and give the range of\nuncertainty.\no Include any contextual information necessary to understand how the\nvolumetric data have been compiled, such as any standard methodologies\nused and any assumptions made.\no If you have left any column blank because you do not have the data,\ndescribe the barriers to reporting that data and any plans to collect and\nreport it.\n\u2022 For \u201cWithdrawals from fresh surface water\u201d, it is important that you state which\nsources apply, e.g. rainwater, water from wetlands, rivers and lakes, etc.. Also state\nif the withdrawal volume for each source is increasing or decreasing. Note: if your\nuse of rainwater equates to more than 5% of your water balance explain if it is\nharvested, treated, etc.\n\u2022 For \u201cThird party sources\u201d, specify whether the third party is a municipal supplier or\nanother type of third party organization.\n\u2022 For discharges to \u201cThird party destinations\u201d, state if this includes water to other\norganizations for further use.\n\u2022 Note: CDP expects withdrawals, discharges and consumption figures to balance\n(approximately; +/- 5%), so if there is a good reason why this cannot happen,\nexplain here.\nPlease explain \u2013 additional guidance for consumption volume\n\u2022 Regarding your water consumption figure, indicate if your figure is based on local\nmeasurements or is a calculation (for example using withdrawals minus\ndischarges).\n\u2022 If known, you may provide breakdown of this figure (with reference to CDP\u2019s\ndefinition of consumption) including:\no Volume incorporated into products, crops or waste;\no Volume evaporated or transpired;\no Volume consumed by humans or livestock;\no Net volume stored in a controlled manner;\no Net volume stored for future use;\no Volumes otherwise excluded from discharges out of the organization\u2019s\nboundary.\n\u2022 It is important to explain a negative consumption figure where this is the case. This\nwould indicate that your discharges are larger than your withdrawals for the\nreporting year e.g., due to a net release of water from storage.\n215\n\nRequested content \u2013 Sector-specific guidance for electric utilities sector\n[sector]\n(if applicable) General\n\u2022 This guidance is specific to companies responding to an electric utilities sector\nrequest. You should first read the guidance for this question that applies to all\ncompanies. This is additional to the general guidance and does not replace it.\nPrimary power generation source for your electricity generation at this facility (column 11)\n\u2022 Choose \u201cNot applicable\u201d if this facility is not an electricity generation facility.\nTotal water withdrawals at this facility (megaliters/year) (column 13)\n\u2022 CDP recognizes the difficulty in accounting for some elements of the hydropower\noperations\u2019 water balance, specifically surface runoff or elements that are outside\nthe organization\u2019s control such as third-party discharges into the reservoir (for\nexample a municipal waste water treatment plant discharging into the reservoir).\nWater withdrawals into hydropower operations includes river inflow, surface runoff\nand precipitation onto the reservoir surface, as well as third-party discharges into\nthe reservoir:\nW = Precipitation + River Inflow + Runoff + Third-party discharges into reservoir\nOrganizations should strive to include volumes for those sources if they would result in an\nestimated error in their water balance of more than 5% (specifically the sum of the\nwithdrawals you report) and take a consistent approach throughout the questionnaire. In the\nlast column (Please explain) you should indicate which sources you have included or\nexcluded. Note that estimation or modelling are valid sources of data.\nTotal water discharges at this facility (megaliters/year) (column 21)\n\u2022 CDP recognizes the difficulty in accounting for some elements of the hydropower\noperations\u2019 water balance, specifically seepage or those that are outside the\norganization\u2019s control such as third-party withdrawals.\nIn hydropower operations, water discharge includes the dam outlet and the spillway,\nunderground seepage and third-party withdrawals from the reservoir (for example a\nmunicipal water plant abstracting from the reservoir).\nD = Dam outlet + Spillway + Seepage + Third-party withdrawals from the reservoir\nOrganizations should strive to include volumes for those destinations if they would\nresult in an estimated error in their water balance of more than 5% (specifically the\nsum of the discharges) and take a consistent approach throughout the\nquestionnaire. In the last column (\"Please explain\") you should indicate which\ndestinations you have included or excluded. Note that estimation or modelling are\nvalid sources of data.\nTotal water consumption at this facility (megaliters/year) (column 27)\n\u2022 Water consumption in hydropower operations includes evaporation from the\nreservoir surface as well as the balance between withdrawals and discharges.\nAlthough organizations should estimate evaporated volumes, you may consider\nvariations in storage as a valid measure of your consumption volumes rather than\ncalculating evaporation and the balance between all withdrawals and discharges.\nThis information is usually easily derived from water level measurements.\n216\n\n\u2022 In the last column (\"Please explain\") provide your approach to reporting a total\nconsumption figure.\nPlease explain (column 29)\n\u2022 If any of the facilities reported are hydropower operations, indicate which elements\nof water withdrawals (river inflow, surface runoff, precipitation onto the reservoir\nsurface and third-party discharges into the reservoir), discharges (spillway,\nunderground seepage and third-party withdrawals from the reservoir) and\nconsumption are you taking into account when providing your response.\n\u2022 Indicate the method followed to obtain it, e.g. direct monitoring, estimation from a\nhydrological model or other secondary source of information.\n\u2022 Explain if any changes in the water discharge volumes are related to higher/lower\nelectricity production or other reasons related to water resources management\nsuch as flood control, satisfaction of downstream demand, etc.\n\u2022 Additionally, you may choose to specify the total evaporated volumes from the\nreservoir if your organization collects this data.\nSector-specific guidance for metals & mining and coal sectors\nGeneral\n\u2022 This guidance is specific to organizations responding to a metals & mining or coal\nsector request. You should first read the guidance for this question that applies to\nall organizations. This is additional to the general guidance and does not replace it.\n\u2022 Data on the production value associated with these facilities will provide further\ninformation on the potential implications of the water risk exposure and assist with\nthe assessment of the organization\u2019s response.\n\u2022 Rainwater: Please note that in the mining industry precipitation/rainwater volumes\nmay constitute a principal input of water at site level. Excluding rainwater from\nwater accounting would not be a true reflection of site water balance.\n\u2022 Brackish water/seawater withdrawals or discharges: Low quality water\nwithdrawals or discharges (categories 2 and 3 of the Water Accounting Framework\nfrom the Mineral Council of Australia) should be reported in columns 16 and 24\n(Brackish water) respectively.\n\u2022 Groundwater withdrawals: Groundwater withdrawals are linked to extraction from\nbore holes and aquifer interception, i.e. groundwater is water that is extracted as\npart of ore body dewatering during mining operations.\n\u2022 Produced/entrained water withdrawals: In the mining industry, entrained water\nrefers to the volumes of water in the raw material, typically ore to be processed.\n\u2022 Groundwater discharges: Discharges to groundwater refer to seepage or aquifer\nreinjection discharge volumes. This aligns with the Water Accounting Framework\nfrom the Mineral Council of Australia\n\u2022 Water diversions: In line with CDP\u2019s definition of water withdrawals and discharges,\nfor the mining industry, water withdrawals and discharges include water diversions\nto enable comparability \u2013 because it is water that crosses the company boundary.\n\u2022 Evaporation: In line with CDP\u2019s definition of water consumption, evaporation from\nopen water surfaces should be reported as part of the water consumption volumes.\n\u2022 Water entrained in waste material: In line with CDP\u2019s definition of water\nconsumption, water entrained in waste material (such as tailings, coarse rejects,\nand concentrates) that leaves the company boundary should not be considered\ndischarges but as part of the consumption volumes.\nSector-specific guidance for oil & gas sector\n217\n\nGeneral\n\u2022 This guidance is specific to companies responding to an oil & gas sector request.\nYou should first read the guidance for this question that applies to all companies.\nThis is additional to the general guidance and does not replace it.\n\u2022 As water withdrawals, consumption, and discharges will vary according to business\ndivision, a business division column has been added to provide data users on the\ntype of facility being reported on. This provides useful context for the volumes\nreported.\n\u2022 Groundwater withdrawals: As part of groundwater withdrawal volumes (be it from\nrenewable or non-renewable sources), organizations should include all withdrawals\nfrom aquifers (other than the formation being exploited). These withdrawals may be\nintended for any use in the organization, including its reinjection to maintain well\npressure or as part of the fracture fluids.\n\u2022 Produced water: In the oil & gas sector, the reporting of water withdrawals volumes\ntypically does not include produced water. To enable comparability, CDP requires all\ncompanies to include produced water volumes in their withdrawals disclosure, in\norder to have an accurate water balance.\n\u2022 Groundwater discharges: In oil production, as part of secondary and tertiary\nrecovery operations, water-based fluids (from various sources) may be used to\nmaintain the pressure, and to displace the hydrocarbons and move them towards\nthe production wells. For CDP disclosure, organizations must report these volumes\nas discharges to groundwater bodies, to enable comparability and have an accurate\nwater balance.\nOil & gas sector business division (column 12)\n\u2022 Select the option \u201cNot applicable\u201d for any facilities not belonging to the oil & gas\nsector.\n\u2022 If you select \"Other, please specify\u201d, please provide a label for the business division\nin the text field provided.\nExplanation of terms \u2022 Brackish surface water/seawater: Surface water in which the concentration of salts\nis high and far exceeds normally acceptable standards for municipal, domestic or\nirrigation use (at least higher than 10,000 mg/l TDS). Seawater has a typical\nconcentration of salts above 35,000 mg/l TDS.\n\u2022 Carbon capture and storage (CCS) (Electric utilities sector only): As defined by the\nIEA, a family of technologies and techniques that enable the capture of carbon dioxide\n(CO2) from fuel combustion or industrial processes, the transport of CO2 via ships or\npipelines, and its storage underground, in depleted oil and gas fields and deep saline\nformations.\n\u2022 Discharges to groundwater: Discharge to groundwater, by human activity or natural\nactivity, refers to a destination beneath the soil surface, such as a water bearing layer\nof rock (aquifer). Examples of discharges to groundwater include disposal of sewage,\ntrade effluent and surface water run-off from urban areas, through such methods as\nspreading basins, soakaways, swales or injection wells.\n\u2022 Facility boundary: This is a management boundary, rather than a physical boundary\nor a legal entity. Water is considered to have crossed the boundary of your facility\nwhen your organization in any way uses it, comes into contact with it, is required to\nmanage it or when it becomes incorporated into your products. It therefore includes\nany water use and management by your organization outside of the physical fence of\n218\n\na facility; for example, to provide a street cleaning service or when used in fields that\nare remote from a processing plant.\n\u2022 Facility reference number: Used to track information related to a facility that is\ndisclosed in different questions. The number is not specific to an organization, but\nsimply avoids an organization having to repeat contextual information such as river\nbasin and facility name.\n\u2022 Fresh surface water, including rainwater, water from wetlands, rivers and lakes:\nWater that is naturally occurring water on the Earth's surface in ice sheets, ice caps,\nglaciers, icebergs, bogs, ponds, lakes, rivers and streams, and has a low concentration\nof dissolved solids.\nFor the purposes of reporting water accounting data to CDP, this surface water source\nincludes water of a quality generally acceptable for, or requiring minimal treatment to\nbe acceptable for, domestic, municipal or agricultural uses (at least <10,000 mg/l TDS,\nthough a range of additional quality properties may also be considered). \u2018High quality\u2019\nfresh water sources considered acceptable for potable use are typically characterized\nas having concentrations of dissolved solids less than 1,000 mg/l.\n\u2022 Groundwater (non-renewable): Water which is being held in, and can be recovered\nfrom, an underground formation. Non-renewable groundwater has a negligible rate of\nnatural recharge on the human time-scale (more than 50 years), and is generally\nlocated at deeper depths than renewable groundwater. This is sometimes referred to\nas \u201cfossil\u201d water.\n\u2022 Groundwater (renewable): Water which is being held in, and can be recovered from,\nan underground formation. Renewable groundwater sources can be replenished within\n50 years and are usually located at shallow depths.\n\u2022 Latitude and longitude: geographic coordinates that specify, respectively, the north-\nsouth and east-west position, of a point on the Earth's surface. These coordinates are\nexpressed as angular measures and thus, latitude can vary from 0 to +/-90 and\nlongitude from 0 to +/-180.\n\u2022 Produced water (Oil & gas sector only): water that is brought to the surface during\nthe production of hydrocarbons including formation water, flow-back water and\ncondensation water (IPIECA \u201cOil and gas industry guidance on voluntary sustainability\nreporting\u201d, 4th edition, 2020).\n\u2022 Produced water: Water which enters the organization\u2019s boundary as a result of the\nextraction, processing, or use of any raw material, so that it must be managed by the\norganization.\nWhen reporting to CDP, this water should not be counted as recycled water when put\nto use within a single cycle of a business process. Examples of produced water\ninclude moisture derived from vegetation such as in sugar cane crushing and the\nwater content in crude oil. (Note that companies with oil and gas activities should refer\nto CDP\u2019s sector specific guidance for this water aspect).\n\u2022 Third party destinations: This includes municipal wastewater plants, public or private\nutilities, and other organizations involved in the transport, treatment, disposal or\nfurther use of wastewater. Note that to qualify as a third-party destination, \u201cother\norganizations\u201d using your wastewater must be outside your reporting boundary given\nin question 1.5. Any of your wastewater that has been treated on your own site should\n219\n\nbe reported as discharge according to its ultimate destination (for example, to\ngroundwater), as this is where any potential risks for the company lie.\n\u2022 Third party sources: This includes water provided by municipal water suppliers, public\nor private utilities, and wastewater from any other organization.\n\u2022 Water consumption: The amount of water drawn into the boundaries of the\norganization (or facility) and not discharged back to the water environment or a third\nparty over the course of the reporting period.\n\u2022 Water discharge: The sum of effluents and other water leaving the boundaries of the\norganization (or facility) and released to surface water, groundwater, or third parties\nover the course of the reporting period.\n\u2022 Water diversions (Metals & mining and coal sectors only): According to the Water\nAccounting Framework from the Mineral Council of Australia water diversions are\nflows from an input to an output without being utilized by the operational facility. The\nflow is not stored with the intention of being used in a task or treated.\n\u2022 Water withdrawal: The sum of all water drawn into the boundaries of the organization\n(or facility) from all sources for any use over the course of the reporting period.",

For CDP disclosure, this is calculated as revenue per total water\nwithdrawal volume in the reporting period (informed by SDG indicator 6.4.1)\nAdditional information \u2018Revenue\u2019 in this calculation for water withdrawal efficiency refers to income arising in the\ncourse of an entity's ordinary activities (less discounts, allowances and returns)\n- before deducting costs for the goods/services sold and operating expenses to arrive at\nprofit. This marks a departure from SDG 6.4.1 and the United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment\u2019s guidance for corporate reporting against the SDG efficiency indicator, which\nasks for Net Value Added \u2013 or revenue after deducting costs.

For example, a organization may have a commitment to improve water\nefficiency that is implemented through locally specific targets and activities that together\ncontribute to a organization-wide target. Only report active targets or targets that have been\nachieved, expired, replaced, or retired during the reporting year.\n\u2022 To add targets, use the \u201cAdd Row\u201d button. You may report up to 25 targets.\n\u2022 Your base year figure , target year figure , and reporting year figure should be reported as\nabsolute numeric values in the unit used by your organization to monitor the target (e.g.,\nmegalitres, mg/L of chemical oxygen demand, proportion of suppliers etc.). The unit used\nshould be consistent in all three figures columns.\nTarget reference number (column 1)\n\u2022 Select a target reference number from the drop-down list to allocate a unique identifier to your\ntarget. This will allow you to track and report progress for this target in future disclosures to\nCDP, until the target is retired. The target reference number is not specific to your\norganization.\n\u2022 When providing information from previously disclosed targets, be sure to use the same\nreference number as in previous years. Targets should keep their reference number in\nsubsequent years. A target reference number may only apply to a single row.\nTarget coverage (column 2)\n\u2022 Select \u201cOrganization -wide (direct operations only)\u201d, if a target applies to your entire reporting\nboundary, but is limited to your direct operations. Note that \u2018organization -wide\u2019 refers\ncollectively to all the companies, businesses, organizations, other entities or groups that fall\nwithin your definition of the reporting boundary.\n\u2022 If a target applies to both your direct operations and upstream value chain, select\n\u201corganization-wide (including suppliers)\".\n\u2022 If the target does not apply to the whole organization, select the option that best describes the\ntarget coverage , and provide further details in the \u201cPlease explain\u201d column. For example, if\nyour target applies only to your European operations, select \u201cCountry/area/region\u201d in this\ncolumn and specify the country/area/region in the \u201cFurther details of target\u201d column.\nCategory of target & Quantitative metric (column 3)\n\u2022 The drop-down options in this column are presented based on your selections in 9.15.1 .\n\u2022 Select the category of target and metric you wish to report. Some metrics are linked to more\nthan one category.\n\u2022 Select the metric used to quantitatively track your progress against the target, or how your\norganization measures the success of this target. If you select \u201cOther, please specify,\u201d provide\na label for the metric.\n\u2022 Note that \u201ccategory of target\u201d refers to broad areas of water action in which targets can be set\nand is not meant to capture further details of the target. Only select \u201cOther, please specify\u201d if\nthe category of target cannot be captured through any other response options.\nDate target was set (column 4)\n\u2022 Enter the date in which your organization set the target.\n\u2022 This must be either before or during the reporting year, but cannot be after the reporting year\nor after the end date of the target year.\n\u2022 If you have a year-on-year rolling target or a maintenance target, enter the date you first set\nthe target. This can be before the base year.\n\u2022 If you set the target based on financial years, enter the year that applies to the end of your\nfinancial year\n\u2022 If you do not know the exact date on which your company set the target, enter the end of the\nyear that the target was set.\n261\n\nEnd date of base year (column 5)\n\u2022 The base year is the year against which you are comparing your target.\n\u2022 The base year cannot be after your reporting year.\n\u2022 If you have a year-on-year rolling target or a maintenance target, the base year will be the\nprevious reporting year.\n\u2022 If you set the target based on financial years, enter the year that applies to the end of your\nfinancial year\n\u2022 If you have a target based on an average over a period of time (e.g., 5-year average), enter the\nyear that applies to the end of the average period.\nBase year figure (column 6)\n\u2022 Indicate the figure that you use as a baseline for your target. This should correspond to data\nobtained during the base year and is the figure against which progress is measured.\n\u2022 This figure will be used to auto-calculate the \u2018% of target achieved relative to base year\u2019 in\ncolumn 11.\nEnd date of target year (column 7)\n\u2022 This date represents when you expect to achieve your target.\n\u2022 Enter the end date of the year that the target ends. For example, if the target is to reduce\nwithdrawals by 20% by the end of 2030, the end date of the target year is 31st December 2030.\n\u2022 If you have a year-on-year rolling target or a maintenance target, the target year will be the\nreporting year.\n\u2022 If you have a target based on financial years, enter the end date of the year that applies to the\nend of your financial year..\n\u2022 You should not report any target that was completed before the start of the reporting year.\nTarget year figure (column 8)\n\u2022 Enter the figure that you are aiming to achieve in the target year.\n\u2022 This should not represent the metric\u2019s percent increase or reduction, but the targeted figure\nfor the metric in the unit used to monitor it. For example, an organization has a target aiming\nfor a reduction of total water withdrawals by 20%, which translates to achieving withdrawals\nof 800 megaliters compared to the \u2018Base year figure\u2019 of 1,000 megaliters. In this case, the\n\u2018Target year figure\u2019 would be 800 megaliters, not 20%.\n\u2022 This figure will be used to auto-calculate the \u2018% of target achieved relative to base year\u2019 in\ncolumn 11.\nReporting year figure (column 9)\n\u2022 Enter the figure achieved in the reporting year.\n\u2022 This figure should be in the same units as the \u2018Base year figure\u2019 and \u2018Target year figure\u2019.\n\u2022 This figure will be used to auto-calculate the \u2018% of target achieved relative to base year\u2019 in\ncolumn 11.\nTarget status in reporting year (column 10)\n\u2022 New - Select this option for targets that have been set in the reporting year and are still in\nprogress.\n\u2022 Underway - Select this option for targets that were set before the reporting year, with an end\ndate in the future, that have not been achieved and continue to be pursued.\n\u2022 Achieved - Select this option for targets that are in place to achieve a certain level of\nperformance (e.g., to achieve 100% suppliers in compliance with water-related requirements)\nand have been achieved or exceeded in the reporting year.\n262\n\n\u2022 Achieved and maintained - Select this option for targets that are in place to maintain a certain\nlevel of performance (e.g., to maintain 100% of suppliers in compliance with water related\nrequirements) and this has been achieved in the reporting year.\n\u2022 Expired - Select this option for targets with an end date within the reporting year, that have\nnot been achieved or maintained and have therefore expired in the reporting year.\n\u2022 Revised - Select this option for targets that were set before the reporting year but a revision\nhas been made to any of the elements in columns 2 to 9 in the reporting year, for example due\nto a recalculation or a change to the end date of the target .\n\u2022 Replaced - Select this option for previously reported targets that have been replaced with\nanother target in the reporting year, for example where a facility target has been incorporated\ninto an organization-wide target.\n\u2022 Retired - Select this option for targets with an end date in the future, that have not been\nachieved, but will no longer be pursued.

Progress is monitored using\nmegaliters as the unit of measurement. This target applies\ncompany-wide with no exclusions in our direct operations, and is\nexpected to extend to our Tier 1 (direct) suppliers with a\nsubstantive impact on water security as a contractual obligation\nwithin the next 2 years. The motivation for the target stemmed from\na corporate objective on maximizing future cost savings (reduced\nwater bills, operational costs, and regulatory costs), while the target\nis also in alignment with our water policy commitment to increase\nfreshwater availability in key river basins. As we have achieved 65%\nalready, we are on track to meet this target as long as progress\nmaintains present pace.\nZero Discharge of Hazardous In order to protect our brand value, in 2019 we set a target to\nChemicals (ZDHC) reduce the release of metal emissions to water in our operations in\nthe Ohio river basin. This target only applies to our sites with direct\ndischarges into water bodies, which are limited to our operations in\nthis basin. We are aiming to reduce the concentration of metal\nemissions to 20% of the 2017 level by 2029, aka from 2.5g to 0.5g\nper ton of copper output. Until this reporting year, we have achieved\n75% of this target, and are on track to achieve the target by 2029.\nOur company set a target in 2017, aiming to increase our revenue\nfrom water efficient products by 20% within the next decade. Our\nmotivation lied in increasing our revenue and brand value through\nthe sales and promotion of water smart products. In 2017 our\n\u2018smart appliances\u2019 range comprised 7 different products of which 1\nwas equipped with a networked meter. By the current reporting\nyear, our \u2018smart appliances\u2019 range has been expanded to 15\nproducts. Additionally, new models with improved efficiency have\nbeen released for several of the products. Our revenues from \u2018smart\nappliances\u2019 have already increased by 12%, putting us at 60% of the\ntarget achieved..\nWe predict that by 2027 we will have 23 smart appliances on the\nmarket and plan to have 10 of these equipped with monitoring\ntechnology. In addition, 4 current products will be retired before\n2027, giving us good confidence in our abilities as a company to\nevolve and improve our smart appliances and to meet our target by\n2027.\n267\n\nTags\nAuthority Type All requesters\nEnvironmental Issue Question level W only\n(Theme)\nQuestionnaire Sector Question level All (Except FS)",

systems (adapted from EMF\u2019s\nCircular Economy Introduction).\n\u2022 Compostable plastics: plastics which biodegrade under controlled conditions characterized\nprimarily by forced aeration and natural heat production from biological activity that degrades\nthe material. This process should align with ISO 170688.\n\u2022 Extended Producer Responsibility: an environmental policy approach in which a producer\u2019s\nresponsibility for a product is extended to the post-consumer stage of a product\u2019s life cycle\n(OECD).\n\u2022 Hazardous substances: compounds exhibiting intrinsically negative properties such as being\npersistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT), very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB),\ncarcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic for reproduction (CMR), or endocrine disruptors (ED)\n(ZDHC, 2022).\n\u2022 Plastics: material containing a polymer (a large chain molecule with repeating molecular\nunits) which can be moulded into a finished product - examples include thermoplastics,\npolyurethanes, elastomers, thermosets, adhesives, coatings and sealants, and PP fibres. For\n20243 CDP disclosure, synthetic rubber is included in our definition (informed by EMF\u2019s report\n\u2018The New Plastics Economy\u2019).\n\u2022 Plastic goods/products: goods and products are used interchangeably throughout. This\nrefers to any finished item made from the conversion of plastic polymers which is\nmanufactured or refined for commercialization or usage.\n\u2022 Plastic packaging: packaging whose main structural element is plastic (corresponding to\n50% of packaging weight). This should include fossil-based, biobased as well as compostable,\nbiodegradable, and oxo-degradable plastic. This also includes:\no Any plastic packaging that is (1) in direct contact with the product, (2) holding several\nunits of packaging, (3) used for the transport of units of packaging (i.e., primary,\nsecondary, and tertiary plastic packaging).\no Any plastic packaging applied to or offered to accompany any products sold (for\nexample, plastic shopping bags, plastic cutlery accompanying food, or crates used to\ntransport products).\n(adapted from EMF\u2019s Global Commitment definitions and reporting guidelines).\n272\n\n\u2022 Recycled content: proportion, by mass, of recycled material in a product. Only pre-consumer\nand post-consumer materials shall be considered as recycled content (adapted from ISO\n14021:2016).\no Pre-consumer recycled content: content that has been recycled\nfrom materials diverted from the waste stream during a\nmanufacturing process (adapted from EMF\u2019s Global Commitment\ndefinitions and reporting guidelines).\no Post-consumer recycled content: content that has been\nrecycled from materials generated by households or by\ncommercial, industrial and institutional facilities in their role as\nend users of the product which can no longer be used for its\nintended purpose (adapted from EMF\u2019s Global Commitment\ndefinitions and reporting guidelines and ISO 14021:2016).\n\u2022 Primary microplastics and plastic particles: small plastic particulates below 5 mm in size,\nwhich are deliberately manufactured and added to products for specific purposes. For\nexample, as an abrasive agent, to control the thickness and appearance of a product or for\nstability (adapted from Plastic Footprint Network and European Chemicals Agency).\n\u2022 Problematic and unnecessary plastics: plastics that meet any of the following criteria:\no It is not reusable, recyclable or compostable;\no It contains, or its manufacturing requires, hazardous chemicals that pose a significant\nrisk to human health or the environment;\no It can be avoided (or replaced by a reuse model) while maintaining utility;\no It hinders or disrupts the recyclability or compostability of other items;\no It has a high likelihood of being littered or ending up in the natural environment.\n(adapted from EMF\u2019s Global Commitment definitions and reporting guidelines)\n\u2022 Recyclable: the ability to reprocess, by means of a manufacturing process, a used material\ninto a product, a component incorporated into a product, or a secondary (recycled) raw\nmaterial; excluding energy recovery and the use of the product as a fuel (adapted from EMF\u2019s\nGlobal Commitment definitions and reporting guidelines and ISO 18604:2013).\n\u2022 Recyclable \u2018in practice and at scale\u2019: successful post-consumer collection, sorting, and\nrecycling, which is proven to work in practice and at scale. The test and threshold for\nassessment is a 30% recycling rate in multiple regions, collectively representing at least 400\nmillion people. A possible alternative, especially relevant for more local players, is to check if a\n30% post-consumer recycling rate is achieved in all the markets where a packaging is sold.\no \u2018At scale\u2019 means that the proof needs to be more than a lab test, a pilot, or a single\nsmall region. It means that recycling of a certain product needs to be proven to work\nin practice in multiple regions, collectively representing a significant geographical area\nin terms of population size, ideally across different country and city archetypes.\no \u2018In practice\u2019 means that within each of these regions, the recycling system (end-to-end\nsystem from consumer to recycled material) effectively recycles a significant share of\nall products of that type put on the market.\n(adapted from EMF\u2019s Global Commitment definitions and reporting guidelines)\n\u2022 Renewable content: proportion, by mass of material in a product, which is derived from\nresources that are replenished at a rate equal to or greater than the rate of depletion (adapted\nfrom EMF\u2019s Circular Economy Glossary).\n273\n\n\u2022 Reusable packaging and reusable plastic products: packaging or a plastic product which\nhas been designed to and proves its ability to accomplish multiple trips or rotations in a\nsystem for reuse after minimal processing (adapted from EMF\u2019s Global Commitment\ndefinitions and reporting guidelines).\n\u2022 Single-use plastic products: a product that is made wholly or partly from plastic and that is\nnot conceived, designed or placed on the market to accomplish, within its life span, multiple\ntrips or rotations by being returned to a producer for refill or re-used for the same purpose for\nwhich it was conceived (Single-Use Plastics Directive).\n\u2022 Target: a specific measurable output to be achieved within a specific timeline. Targets often\nact as steps towards a wider and long-term corporate goal.\n\u2022 Virgin content: proportion, by mass of material in a product, which is derived from materials\nthat have not been previously used or subjected to processing other than for their original\nproduction. In the context of plastic, virgin materials are materials not produced from post-\nindustrial or post-consumer recycled material (adapted from EMF\u2019s Circular Economy\nGlossary).\nTags\nAuthority type All requesters\nEnvironmental Issue Question level P\n(Theme)\nQuestionnaire sector Question level All (except FS)\nActivities",

          "answer": "Recyclable 'in practice and at scale' means successful post-consumer collection, sorting, and recycling, which is proven to work in practice and at scale. The test and threshold for assessment is a 30% recycling rate in multiple regions, collectively representing at least 400 million people. A possible alternative, especially relevant for more local players, is to check if a 30% post-consumer recycling rate is achieved in all the markets where a packaging is sold."

For example, Deposit Return Systems or\nseparate collection, and any relevant incentives or leverages. If applicable, explain why data is\nnot collected and any plans for future data collection.\nExplanation of \u2022 Composting (industrial/home): a process primarily characterized by forced aeration and\nterms natural heat production from biological activity that degrades material. This can either be done\nin an industrial facility or at home. Industrial composting processes must align with ASTM\nD6400. Compostable plastics must align with ISO 17088.\n\u2022 End-of-life management: the stage of the lifecycle where goods, materials and substances are\nno longer in use and go through a management system to process them for preparation for\nreuse, recycling, or disposal (adapted from European Environmental Bureau and Pew Charitable\nTrusts).\n\u2022 End-of-life management pathway: a generalized term used to describe the type of waste\ntreatment process goods, materials and substances undergo once they reach end-of-life.\n\u2022 Incineration: the process of controlled, high-temperature combustion to destroy, render inert,\nor reduce waste to ash. This excludes Waste to Energy (adapted from ISO 24161).\n\u2022 Landfill: a permanent (i.e., more than one year) waste disposal site for the deposit of the waste\nonto or into land (i.e., underground). This can also be internal, where a producer of waste is\ncarrying out their own waste disposal at the place of production (adapted from the Landfill\nDirective).\n289\n\n\u2022 Leakage: the process of goods, materials or substances leaving the technosphere (human\nenvironment) and accumulating in the natural environment (adapted from Plastic Footprint\nNetwork).\n\u2022 Mismanaged waste: goods, materials or substances that are either littered or inadequately\ndisposed. Inadequately disposed waste is not formally managed and includes disposal in\ndumps or open, uncontrolled landfills, where it is not fully contained. Waste is also considered\nmismanaged when its collection or disposal route creates a chance for it to be lost and\npotentially released into the environment. This includes waste that is not appropriately\ntransported, collected, or stored (adapted from Jambeck et al., 2015 and IUCN The Marine\nPlastic Footprint).\n\u2022 Preparation for reuse: checking, cleaning, or repairing recovery operations, by which goods,\nmaterials or substances that have reached end-of-life are prepared so that they can be re-used\nwithout any other pre-processing (adapted from WRAP and the Waste Framework Directive).\n\u2022 Production of plastics: Production refers to manufacturing processes used to make plastic\nproducts. For example, for polymers this will refer to the polymerization process of monomers.\nFor durable goods, this could refer to processes such as injection molding to create desired\nshapes and structures. For packaging, this could refer to processes of melting, extrusion and\nsealing to form the plastic packaging.\n\u2022 Recycling: any recovery operation by which waste materials are reprocessed into goods,\nmaterials or substances for the original or other purposes. This excludes Waste to Energy\n(adapted from ISO 15270 and the Waste Framework Directive).\n\u2022 Waste to Energy: any waste treatment process designed to recover energy from waste in the\nform of electricity or heat. This process is also called Energy Recovery (adapted from Plastic\nLeak Project and UNFCCC).\nTags\nAuthority type All requesters\nEnvironmental Issue Question level P\n(Theme)\nQuestionnaire sector Question level All (except FS)\n290\n\nModule 11: Environmental Performance \u2013 Biodiversity\nModule overview\nModule \u2022 The data disclosed in this module will help with the understanding of the interdependence\nOverview between biodiversity and business resilience.

The area of direct impacts caused by mining-related activities includes the physical\nmine site footprint, areas adjacent to the project site that are affected by emissions and\neffluents, power transmission corridors, pipelines, borrow and disposal areas, etc., and the\narea affected by associated facilities that, although not part of the project that is being\nassessed, would not have been constructed in the absence of the project. Areas indirectly\naffected by mining-related activities include the physical footprint of non-project activities in\nthe surrounding area that are caused or stimulated by the project plus the area affected by\ntheir emissions and effluents (IRMA, 2018, adapted from Gullison et al. 2015).\nArtisanal and small-scale mining (ASM): formal or informal mining operations with\npredominantly simplified forms of exploration, extraction, processing, and transportation.

ASM can include\nmen and women working on an individual basis as well as those working in family groups, in\npartnership, or as members of cooperatives or other types of legal associations and\nenterprises involving hundreds or even thousands of miners. For example, it is common for\nworkgroups of 4-10 individuals, sometimes in family units, to share tasks at one single point of\nmineral extraction (e.g. excavating one tunnel). At the organizational level, groups of 30-300\nminers are common, extracting jointly one mineral deposit (e.g. working in different tunnels),\nand sometimes sharing processing facilities (OECD, 2016).\nMining project area: the total area of land owned, leased or managed by the organization for a\ngiven mining project, including areas that have not been disturbed by mining-related activities.\nAdditional\ninformation \u2022 The following publications provide further guidance on the interaction between large-scale\nmining and artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM):\n- World Bank. 2009.

The\nviability of a biodiversity value is a function of its irreplaceability and vulnerability.\nIrreplaceability relates to the number of sites or the geographic extent where the value is\npresent; if a biodiversity value (for example, a rare habitat type) occurs only at a few sites, then\nit is highly irreplaceable. Vulnerability relates to the impact and likelihood of existing and future\nthreats; a vulnerable biodiversity value is one that has experienced rapid loss over recent\nhistory and/or is faced by current threats that will lead to rapid loss ( (Hardner et. al., 2015)\nConservation status: Least Concern (LC), Near Threatened (NT), Vulnerable (VU), Endangered\n(EN), Critically Endangered (CR) and Extinct in the Wild (EW) are categories of global extinction\nrisk, based on the IUCN Red List classification system. Species classified as VU, EN and CR\nare considered to be threatened species.

The area of direct impacts caused by mining-related activities includes the physical\nmine site footprint, areas adjacent to the project site that are affected by emissions and\neffluents, power transmission corridors, pipelines, borrow and disposal areas, etc., and the\narea affected by associated facilities that, although not part of the project that is being\nassessed, would not have been constructed in the absence of the project. Areas indirectly\naffected by mining-related activities include the physical footprint of non-project activities in\nthe surrounding area that are caused or stimulated by the project plus the area affected by\ntheir emissions and effluents (IRMA, 2018, adapted from Gullison et al. 2015).\nArtisanal and small-scale mining (ASM): formal or informal mining operations with\npredominantly simplified forms of exploration, extraction, processing, and transportation. ASM\nis normally low capital intensive and uses high labor intensive technology.

Put simply,\nthey are emissions that occur at sources owned or controlled by other companies, but which\nare made possible because those companies are financed by the investment and lending of\nfinancial institutions; and therefore are indirect to the financial institution and should be\nincluded in the financial institution\u2019s Scope 3 inventory.\n\u2022 Other carbon footprinting and/or exposure metrics: Metrics organizations in the financial\nsector can use to understand how their financial portfolio impacts the climate, as identified by\nthe TCFD and to be used alongside portfolio emission metrics:\no Carbon intensity: Volume of carbon emissions per million dollars of revenue\n(carbon efficiency of a portfolio), expressed in tons CO2e/Million revenue (in unit\ncurrency).\no Weighted average carbon intensity: Portfolio\u2019s exposure to carbon-intensive\ncompanies, expressed in tons CO2e/Million revenue. This is the metric\nrecommended by the TCFD.\no Portfolio carbon footprint: Total carbon emissions for a portfolio normalized by\nthe market value of the portfolio, expressed in tons CO2e/Million invested.\n\u2022 Portfolio: in the context of this questionnaire your portfolio is your entire collection of the core\nfinancing activities and insurance policies that you offer. For banking, this is the entire\ncollection of products, securities and loans held on your balance sheet for which you own the\nreceivable stream. For asset managers, this is the entire collection of your products and\ninvestments that you hold and/or manage on behalf of your clients. For asset owners, this is\nthe entire collection of products, funds and investments owned and controlled by your\ncompany. For investment portfolios, asset managers should consider discretionary\ninvestments, those where the company has discretion over investment decision.

Energy, 2. Transportation, 3. Materials and\nBuildings, and 4. Agriculture, Food, and Forest Products) identified by the TCFD.\n\u2022 Emissions to water: discharge of solid, liquid or gaseous pollutants or contaminants into a\nbody of water.\no The Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation (SFDR) defines \u201cemissions to\nwater\u201d as \u201cdirect emissions of priority substances as defined in Article 2(30) of\nDirective 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and direct\nnitrates, direct phosphate emissions, direct pesticides emissions as referred to\nin that Directive, Council Directive of 12 December 1991 concerning the\nprotection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural\nsource (91/676/EEC), Council Directive 91/271/EEC of 21 May 1991 concerning\nurban waste-water treatment, and Directive 2010/75/EU of the European\nParliament and Council.\u201d\n\u2022 Insurance-associated emissions: absolute insurance-associated emissions (tCO2e) are a\nsupplementary accounting note to the GHG Protocol Scope 3 Category 15 \u201cInvestments\u201d.

Breaking down emissions\nand other carbon footprinting and/or exposure metrics by asset class can give an\nindication of the relative GHG emissions performance and/or exposure to climate-related\nrisks of your company\u2019s assets. When reported over time, your organization and investors\nwill be able to review improvements or declines in asset performance with considerations\nfor your portfolio\u2019s impact on the climate. This breakdown can be used alongside the\nfinancial performance of a company\u2019s assets to understand the financial exposure and\nillustrate the scale of contributions to climate change. Because methodologies are more\nrobust for some asset classes than others, providing this level of data will enable data\nusers to identify gaps in the methodologies and lead to the expansion of coverage.\n\u2022 Portfolio breakdown by industry: as sectoral decarbonization is at the center of some\ncarbon footprinting methodologies, breaking down emissions, other carbon footprinting\nand/or exposure metrics on an industry level is key to identify concentrations of carbon-\nrelated assets in the financial sector and the financial system\u2019s exposure to climate-related\nrisks. Reporting at this level can provide a useful indicator for making comparisons\nbetween your financial activities in different industries. In some cases, particular industries\n378\n\nmay come within the scope of particular legislation, therefore, providing industry-level\nemissions and/or exposure figures may give data users insight into your organization\u2019s\ncurrent/potential exposure to regulation in this industry.\n\u2022 Portfolio breakdown by Scope: current methodologies for calculating portfolio emissions\ncan lead to double counting across scopes. For example, what are counted as Scope 1\nemissions for an electricity generation company could be the same emissions for a retailer\nbut counted as Scope 2. There is currently no way for financial institutions to overcome\nthis in their portfolio emission calculations, but this question allows you to report\nemissions by scope separately. Breaking down absolute emissions of their portfolio by\nscope can help financial institution identify emissions throughout the value chain of\ncompanies in their portfolio. PCAF recommends that emissions associated with loans and\ninvestments should be reported separately by Scope if it serves financial institutions\u2019\nbusiness goals (e.g. Scope 1 emissions of investees or Scope 2 emissions of investees).\n\u2022 Portfolio impact: impact of financial activities, namely lending, investment and insurance\nunderwriting, on the environment.\nTags\nAuthority type All requesters\nEnvironmental Issue Question level CC only\n(Theme)\nSector Question level FS only",

It\nalso includes timber products used for biomass.\no Palm oil: crude palm oil, palm kernel oil, and all of its derivatives. Please note\nthat palm oil used for biofuel production is also included in this category.\no Cattle products: all food products containing beef, all clothing, furniture and\naccessories that are made of leather, tallow, and all other products derived from\ncattle. Please note that tallow used for biofuel production is also included in this\ncategory. Dairy products are not included in this category.\no Soy: all meal or oil containing soy and any derivatives that are obtained from soy.\nPlease note that soy used for biofuel production is also included in this category.\no Rubber: all rubber products deriving from natural rubber production. Please note\nthat the tire industry is included in this category.\no Cocoa: all food or other products containing cocoa, cocoa derivatives such as\ncocoa butter or pectin, or any products derived from cocoa husks such as animal\nfeed or potash.\no Coffee: all products from or derived from coffee plants, including the beans,\ncherries and husks\n\u2022 Production: the first stage of the upstream value chain, often entailing the production of raw\nagricultural and forest products by farm owners, smallholders, and communities. Vertically\nintegrated companies are also involved in producing activities if they own or manage land used\nfor production (adapted from Global Canopy, 2018 and AFi, 2024).\n\u2022 Processing: the series of actions that transform raw materials from their natural state to an\ninitial processed state in preparation for market or further processing/manufacturing.\no Organizations involved in the production of crude palm oil from crushed fruit or the\nproduction of soybean oil and soybean meal from soybean would select this activity.\nFurther processing activities in the form of refining and fractionation should be\nconsidered in the manufacturing stage.\no In the case of timber products, organizations whose activities include the initial\nprocessing of timber products in mills (i.e., sawmills, plywood and veneer mills, pulp\nand paper mills) would select this stage.\no For cattle products, activities at this stage primarily involve the slaughtering of cattle\nand the processing of raw hide into leather.\n\u2022 Trading: purchasing and selling raw or primary processed agricultural or forestry materials to\ndomestic or export markets. This includes shipments, transport, and storage of the\ncommodities.\n\u2022 Manufacturing: the series of actions, methods, and techniques that transform raw or\nprocessed materials into final products ready for human use/consumption.\no In palm oil and soybean supply chains, this stage may include the refining of oil into\nshortening and the use of ingredients in the manufacture of bakery products.\no For timber products, the manufacturing stage involves the secondary processing of\nwood into multiple products. This may include furniture, flooring, plywood and boards,\n394\n\nas well as other building materials. For pulp and paper, this may include the conversion\nof pulp to printing and writing paper, newsprint, tissue, container boards, and\npackaging.\no Organizations may manufacture cattle products into products containing beef (e.g.,\nretail meat products, fast food, byproducts including glycerin/gelatin) and leather\nproducts for various industries (e.g., footwear, clothing, furniture and car upholstery)\n(adapted from Global Canopy, 2018 and AFi, 2024).\n\u2022 Retailing: selling products directly to individual consumers.

taxonomy\u201d.\n\u2022 Explain why you are not providing values of the financing and/or insurance of activities or\nsectors that are eligible under or aligned with a sustainable finance taxonomy.\nExplanation of \u2022 Activity enabling climate change adaptation: the activity enables a substantial\nterms contribution to be made to climate change adaptation in other activities. For example, the\nactivity is developing adaptation solutions.\n\u2022 Activity enabling climate change mitigation: the activity enables a substantial\ncontribution to be made to climate change mitigation in other activities. For example, the\nactivity enables other activities to achieve emissions reductions.\n\u2022 Adapted activity: the activity is being performed in a way that it itself contributes\nsubstantially by making a positive impact or removing a negative impact on climate\nchange adaptation. For example, where the activity adopts adaptation solutions. If you are\ndisclosing alignment against the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities, note that\nactivities may qualify as substantially contributing through own performance if they meet\nthe corresponding technical screening criteria established by the Climate Delegated Act\n(Annex II- pg. 146- 346).\n\u2022 Capital Expenditure (CAPEX): a measure of the value of purchases of fixed assets such as\nproperty, buildings, an industrial plant, technology, or equipment. Put differently, CAPEX is\nany type of expense that a company capitalizes, or shows on its balance sheet as an\ninvestment, rather than on its income statement as an expenditure. In case of reporting to\nthe EU Taxonomy, please refer the explanation for \u201cKey Performance Indicators\u201d below, for\nfurther information on the exact reporting requirements of the CAPEX KPI.\n\u2022 Climate change adaptation: the process of adjustment to actual and expected climate\nchange and its impacts.\n406\n\n\u2022 Climate change mitigation: the process of holding the increase in the global average\ntemperature to well below 2\u00b0C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial\nlevels, as laid down in the Paris Agreement.\n\u2022 \u201cDo No Significant Harm\u201d principle: a taxonomy-eligible activity that substantially\ncontributes to one or more of the taxonomy\u2019s objectives and complies with international\nbest practices for sustainable business and social safeguards may only qualify as an\nenvironmentally sustainable (i.e., \u201ctaxonomy-aligned\u201d) if it does not cause significant harm\nto any other environmental objective. In relation to the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable\nActivities, this refers to the conditions specified under Article 17 of the EU Taxonomy\nRegulation.\n\u2022 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): in relation to the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable\nActivities, the KPIs refer to the proportion of the turnover and capital expenditure (CAPEX)\nrelated to assets or processes associated with environmentally sustainable economic\nactivities. For each of the Turnover KPI, CAPEX KPI, this refers to the numerator divided by\nthe denominator as specified by the Disclosure Delegated Act (Annex I p17- 19).\n\u2022 Substantial contribution: a taxonomy-eligible activity is said to substantially contribute to\none or more environmental objectives under a taxonomy when it, through its own\nperformance, meets the corresponding technical screening criteria set out by the relevant\ntaxonomy. In relation to the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities this refers to the\ntechnical screening criteria established by the Climate Delegated Act (Annexes I and II).\n\u2022 Sustainable finance taxonomy: as defined by the Bank for International Settlements, a\nsustainable finance taxonomy is a set of criteria which can form the basis for an evaluation\nof whether and to what extent a financial asset can support given sustainability goals. The\ncentral goal of taxonomies is driving capital allocation towards sustainable activities,\nreducing greenwashing, and enabling simpler comparison.\n\u2022 Taxonomy-aligned: an activity is considered \u2018taxonomy-aligned\u2019 if your organization\ngenerates turnover or invests in capital or operating expenditure corresponding to such\nactivities, and the activity meets the technical screening criteria and do no significant harm\ncriteria prescribed by the sustainable finance taxonomy and complies with international\nbest practices for sustainable business and social safeguards.\n\u2022 Taxonomy-eligible but not aligned: an activity is considered \u2018taxonomy-eligible but not\naligned\u2019 if your organization generates turnover or invests in capital or operating\nexpenditure corresponding to an activity, but the activity does not meet the technical\nscreening criteria and/or do no significant harm criteria prescribed by the sustainable\nfinance taxonomy and/or does not comply with international best practices for sustainable\nbusiness and social safeguards.\n\u2022 Transitional activity: the activity does not have a technologically or economically feasible\nlow-carbon alternative, but substantially contributes to climate change mitigation by\nsupporting the transition to a net-zero carbon economy consistent with a pathway to limit\nthe temperature increase to 1.5C above preindustrial levels.\n\u2022 Turnover: \u201cnet turnover\u201d means the amounts derived from the sale of products and the\nprovision of services after deducting sales rebates and value added tax and other taxes\ndirectly linked to turnover, as per Article 2(5) of Directive 2013/34/EU (The Accounting\nDirective). In case of reporting to the EU Taxonomy, please refer the explanation for \u201cKey\nPerformance Indicators\u201d below, for further information on the exact reporting requirements\nof the Turnover KPI.\nTags\nAuthority Type All requesters\n407\n\nEnvironmental Issue Question level CC Only\n(Theme)\nQuestionnaire Sector Question level FS Only\nEnvironmentally sustainable products/services (FS only)",

Inclusion here does not mean that CDP has made a\njudgement about the standards or is promoting the use of any particular standard above\nanother.\n\u2022 Refer to the following criteria when considering if a verification standard is credible:\no Relevance: The standard should specify that it relates to a third-party audit or\nverification process; for a program-related standard, third-party verification should\nbe specified as part of the program compliance.\no Competency: The standard should include a statement regarding the competency of\nverifiers; where it is a program and verification parties are stipulated, competency is\nassumed to be determined by the second party and therefore need not be explicit in\nthe standard.\no Independence: The standard should contain a requirement that ensures that\nimpartiality is maintained in cases where the same external organization compiles\nand verifies a responding organization\u2019s inventory.\no Terminology: The standard should specify the meaning of any terms used for the\nlevel of the finding (e.g. limited assurance; reasonable assurance).\no Methodology: The standard should describe a methodology for the verification that\nincludes the verification of the process and/or system controls and the data.\no Availability: The standard should be available for scrutiny.\nFurther details of the third-party verification/assurance process (column 4)\n\u2022 You may use this column to provide additional details about the verification/assurance\nprocess such as:\no How often the verification/assurance is performed;\no The scope it encompasses (i.e., whether it applies to your direct operations only,\nto your upstream/downstream value chain; or only to selected regions, facilities,\nand products);\no The rationale for the chosen data points, and standard;\no The level of insurance the verification provides (i.e., Limited assurance,\nModerate assurance, Reasonable assurance, or High assurance); and\no Any parts of the data point selected in column 2 that are excluded from the\nverification process, and why.\n430\n\n\u2022 If you are reporting verification/assurance of target-related details, provide any relevant\ntarget reference numbers.\nAttach verification/assurance evidence/report (optional) (column 5)\n\u2022 You may attach a copy of your verifier\u2019s report or equivalent document here. This is optional\nbut will support the robustness of your disclosure.\nRequested Note for financial services companies:\ncontent \u2013 [sector] \u2022 Disclose the verification of data in module 12: Environmental performance \u2013 Financial\n(if applicable) services, other than data disclosed in 12.1.1 and/or 12.1.3.\n\u2022 The verification of financed emissions as per 12.1.1 and/or 12.1.3 should be disclosed in\n7.9.3.\nAdditional \u2022 For further details on good practice for verification and assurance refer to CDP\u2019s guide on\ninformation the business benefits of third-party verification of environmental data.\n\u2022 There is no requirement for data to be verified twice, as such data that has already been\nverified for one scheme/reporting effort can normally be used for another.
