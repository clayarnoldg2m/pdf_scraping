Requested General
content • CDP recommends that organizations provide most recent 12-month period for which you
have complete data, if possible. If you do not have data for the entire reporting year, consider
the following options:
o Extrapolate or estimate your data to cover the entire reporting year.
o Outline in the relevant questions any exclusions from your disclosure.
• Apply this reporting year to all your answers throughout the questionnaire, except where the
ability is provided to specify other reporting periods (e.g., base year, target year).
• In column 3 “Indicate if you are providing data for past reporting years”, select “No” unless
you are restating data or you are a first-time responder providing data from past years.
• If providing multiple years of data, only data pertaining to the most recent reporting 12-month
period will be scored.
End date of reporting year (column 1)
• This date should be the same as the “End date of reporting year” reported in your
Questionnaire Set-up.
• The start date will be automatically assumed to be exactly 365 days before the listed date.
For example, if you enter an end date of 31/12/2023, your start date will be automatically
assumed to be 01/01/2023.
Alignment of this reporting period with your financial reporting period (column 2)
• Whilst CDP does not require organizations to synchronize their reporting year with their
fiscal year, the investment community generally prefers an organization’s reporting year for
environmental disclosure to match the fiscal year for their financial jurisdiction. This
facilitates the assessment of environmental performance data in alignment with financial

• When reporting intensity figures using a financial metric throughout the questionnaire,

Rationale This question helps data users interpret how your responses relate to your business
operations. Your response to this question defines the set of entities (companies, businesses,
other groups, etc.) that you are providing data for in the CDP questionnaire.
Ambition • The organization uses the same reporting boundary as the boundary used in the
preparation of their financial statements.
• The reporting boundary is applied consistently throughout reporting. Where relevant,
the organization provides information on the value chain outside of the boundary as
supplementary information relating to the dependencies, impacts, risks, and
opportunities identified by the organization.

[Fixed row]
Requested content General
• The reporting boundary defines the set of entities (companies, businesses, other
groups, etc.) that you are providing data for.
• Unless stated otherwise, the information you provide in response to CDP’s
corporate questionnaire should be presented as one result covering all the entities
indicated as falling within your reporting boundary in this question.
• Throughout this questionnaire, “your organization” and “organization-wide” will be
used to refer collectively to the entities included within the reporting boundary
defined here.
Page 13 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net

• CDP recommends that you consult your legal or accounting advisor when
determining your reporting boundary.
• Note that you will be requested to indicate the consolidation approach chosen to
calculate environmental performance data (e.g., GHG emissions, water
withdrawals, deforestation- and conversion-free status of commodity volumes, etc.)
to your organization in 6.1.
Is your reporting boundary for your CDP disclosure the same as that used in your financial
statement? (column 1)
• Using a reporting boundary aligned with the reporting boundary used for your
financial accounting is preferable, as it is important for consistency and
accountability.
• CDP is committed to deliver comprehensive and robust environmental data to the
market by aligning with global standards. Using the same reporting boundary as
that used in your financial statements aligns with the requirements of the IFRS and
ESRS reporting standards.
How does your reporting boundary differ to that used in your financial statement (column
2)
• This column is only presented if “No” is selected in column 1 “Is your reporting
boundary for your CDP disclosure the same as that used in your financial
statement?”.
• Provide details on why your reporting boundary is not the same as the reporting
boundary used in the preparation of financial statements. Include details as to how
the reporting boundary differs from your financial statements, such as any entities
included in your financial reporting that are not included in your CDP response.

insurance in some regions.
o Life and/or health: life insurance is a type of insurance that pays out upon the
death of an insured person, and health (or medical) insurance is a type of
insurance that covers the cost of medical care.
• CDP recognizes that some questions are not relevant to insurers that provide only life
and/or health insurance, and so your selection here determines which response options
related to due diligence, exclusion policies and portfolio impact will appear. Therefore, if
you are an insurer providing only life and/or health insurance, select only the “Life and/or
health” option.
• Please note that this is relevant to your insurance underwriting activities only. You are still

Rationale Business activities within the ‘agricultural commodities’, ‘food, beverage and tobacco’, and
‘paper and forestry’ sectors are directly related to greenhouse gas emissions and
water usage. Disclosing the activities that these organizations engage in - whether in
direct operations or in other parts of the value chain -provides data users with the
contextual information necessary to understand and evaluate how they assess and
manage climate- and water-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities.
This also enables data users to make more accurate cross-organizational and cross-

Activity (column 0)
Page 23 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net

• Respond to each specified activity, considering the entire value chain of your
organization.
• Emissions sources and water-related impacts of production activities:
o Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions released as a result of
decaying or burning of biological or soil organic matter, fuel combustion and
electricity generation in farm operation, digestion of livestock, stored manures
and rice cultivation.
o Contribution to water stress regarding surface and/or groundwater resources
through excessive or unsustainable water management practices.
o Alteration of water availability due to land use changes (e.g., deforestation,
irrigation practices).
o Pollution of water sources through runoff, including pesticides, fertilizers and
other chemicals.
• Emissions and water-related impacts of the processing of raw materials and wood or
the manufacture of food, beverage and tobacco products are associated with all processes
adopted, and all methods and techniques used, to transform raw agricultural inputs/timber
products into final products ready for human consumption, including:
o Pre-processing (relevant if companies use processed inputs, e.g. sugar);
o Primary grading/ screening to ensure uniformity;
o Storage during different processing stages;
o Cleaning to remove and separate off-specification material, organic and non-
organic debris, metals, and pesticide residues among other contaminants;
o Cutting, trimming, rolling and peeling to re-shape and remove inedible parts;
o Cooking, canning, evaporating, drying and freezing;
o Pulping and filtration;
o Packaging of the final product to provide containment, protection,
communication, and convenience, including, packaging for transport e.g. crates
or pallets; and
o Waste generated during processing activities.
• Distribution encompasses the entire network required to move products through the
value chain from the farm/production unit to the retail location. Consider all the distribution
stages in your disclosure:
o Transportation of raw agricultural/forest products to processing facilities;
o Transportation of material inputs to processing facilities, for example,
packaging materials, chemicals, wood and any other ingredients;
o Product distribution from processing facilities to the retailer/customer;
o Transportation of waste to disposal sites or to points of re-use;
o In each of the cases listed for transportation above, you should also account
for emissions and water-related impacts from empty return journeys, storage of
goods during distribution (as this can often require specific controls for
humidity, temperature, atmospheric conditions and hygiene requirements) and
the waste generated during transportation.
• The consumption stage includes the use of goods as well as their waste management,
including disposal and end-of-life treatment of products sold by the reporting organization.
Consider:
o Cooling, freezing and heating of sold products;
o Waste disposal and end of life treatment of products, i.e., activities associated
with land filling, incineration, composting, repurposing, recycling.
o Discharge treatment
o Note that the calculation of emissions and water-related impacts associated
with consumption and end life treatment may require reporting companies to
make assumptions regarding how consumers use products, product lifetimes
and end of life treatment methods chosen by consumers.
Page 24 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net

Relevance of emissions and/or water-related impacts (column 1)
• If your organization has emissions and/or water-related impacts from an activity, specify
which aspects of your value chain it relates to. Select:
o “Own land only” if all your agricultural products are grown on self-
owned/managed farms;
o "Value chain (excluding own land)” if all your agricultural products are grown on
farms which are not owned/managed by your organization;
o “Value chain (including own land)” if your agricultural products are grown on
self-owned/managed farms, and on farms not owned/managed by your
organization;
o “Upstream/downstream value chain (excluding direct operations)” if all your
agricultural inputs are purchased; or
o “Both direct operations and upstream/downstream value chain” if a combination
of product cultivation and purchasing is applicable to your organization.
• If you wish to add or delete an activity later in the questionnaire, revisit this question and
modify your response accordingly. Selecting “No” will erase your previous responses to
linked questions.
Primary reason emissions and/or water-related impacts from this activity are not relevant
(column 2)
If “No” is selected in column 1 “Relevance of emissions and/or water-related impacts”, select
the primary reason why emissions and/or water related impacts are not relevant to your CDP
disclosure.
If either “Value chain (excluding own land)” or “Upstream/downstream value chain (excluding
direct operations)” is selected in column 1 “Relevance of emissions and/or water-related
impacts”, select the primary reason why emissions and/or water related impacts are not
relevant to your own land or direct operations.
Explain why emissions and/or water-related impacts from this activity are not relevant (column
3)
• If “Analysis in progress”, “Do not own/manage land”, “Outside the value chain of my
organization” or “Judged to be unimportant or not relevant” is selected in column 2
“Primary reason for no emissions or water-related impacts from this activity”, describe
your evaluation methods, indicating the procedures and tools used for evaluating the
relevance of this activity. Specify parts of your business included in the analysis and
the criteria used to decide that the activity was not relevant.
• If “Analysis in progress” is selected in column 2 “Primary reason for no emissions or
water-related impacts from this activity”, provide a date for when it will be finalized.
• If “Lack of internal resources, capabilities, or expertise (e.g., due to organization size)”
is selected in column 2 “Primary reason for no emissions or water-related impacts from
this activity”, specify the main challenges you experience.
• If “Lack of internal resources, capabilities, or expertise (e.g., due to organization size)”
or “Not evaluated due to insufficient data on operations” is selected in column 2
“Primary reason for no emissions or water-related impacts from this activity”, indicate if
you have any plans to evaluate the relevancy of this activity to your disclosure in the
next two years and if so, describe the methods and coverage for this upcoming
analysis.

Question dependencies This question only appears if ‘Electricity generation’ is selected in column “Aspect” of
1.16.
Change from last year Modified question (2023 C-EU8.2d, W-EU0.1b)
Rationale Each power generation source is associated with specific dependencies, impacts,
risks, and opportunities, requiring tailored management procedures and future
planning. For example, hydropower will use and impact water resources in a
different way to biomass power generation plants. Asking organizations to
disclose their power generation sources provides data users with the contextual
information necessary to understand and evaluate how they assess and manage
climate- and water-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities. This
also enables data users to make more accurate cross-organizational and cross-
industry comparisons.

content • Report nameplate capacity by primary power generation sources owned or controlled by
your organization.
• Report your preferred measure (gross or net) of generation. Although CDP encourages
disclosure of both, reporting one measure is sufficient.
• Refer to the CDP Technical note on Biofuels for guidance on biomass/biofuel
sustainability.
Power generation source (column 0)
• Biomass may be combusted on its own or co-fired with other fuels. Provide aggregated
data.
• Waste can include tire-derived fuels and other refuse-derived fuels. When reporting in this
category, only report the nameplate capacity and gross electricity generation data from the
non-biomass fraction. The biomass fraction should be reported under either biomass
option.
• Hydropower does not include pumped storage operations for the reporting of nameplate
capacity and gross electricity generation. CDP regards it as a form of managing or storing
energy rather than primary generation. Note you will be asked to report water accounting
volumes for these operations.
• “Other renewable” and “Other non-renewable” are aggregations of any other renewable
and non-renewable energy generation technologies you use that are not listed (e.g.
renewably derived hydrogen or hydrogen derived from fossil fuels, respectively).
• If your organization’s power plant capacity combines various small-scale generation
technologies that are challenging to report individually, you can group them as either
renewable or non-renewable sources. Report the total capacity of aggregated renewable
sources under “Other renewable” and the total capacity of aggregated non-renewable
sources under the “Other non-renewable”. You can explain the methodology utilized and
list the small-scale technologies used in the comment section.
Comment (column 5) (optional)
• Use this column to provide any additional relevant information.
• If you report information in the “Sustainable biomass” row, provide the criteria used to
classify the biomass as sustainable (e.g. certification).
• If you report information in any of the biomass rows, specify if the biomass technology
refers to bioenergy plants fitted with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).

Rationale This question indicates your organization’s dependence on commodities by establishing and
contextualizing the total volumes that you produced and/or sourced in the reporting period.
Reporting this information provides context to data users on how relevant the commodities are
to your organization. Organizations benefit from disclosing this information by increasing
awareness of their own dependency on commodities and promoting transparency of their
business activities, which are important steps towards deforestation- and conversion-free value
chains.

4 “Indicate if you can provide the total commodity volume associated with commodity
production and/or sourcing”.
• State the total volume of soy that you directly source and/or produce in metric tons. If you
produce and directly source soy, combine the volume here. You will have the opportunity to
exclude volumes from this total in question 8.1 and 8.1.1 on exclusions.
• The value stated in this column and the value stated in column 6 “Of the total commodity
volume, state how much is embedded soy (metric tons)” should sum to value stated in
column 5 “Total commodity volume”.
Did you convert the total commodity volume from another unit to metric tons? (column 8)
• This column is only presented if “Yes, we are providing the total commodity volume” is
selected in column 4 “Indicate if you are providing the total commodity volume that is
produced and/or sourced”.
• Select “Yes” if you needed to convert your volumes from another unit (e.g., Liters, Square
meters) to disclose in metric tons.
Original unit (column 9)
• This column is only presented if “Yes” is selected in column 8 “Did you convert the total
commodity volume from another unit to metric tons?”.
Provide details on the methods, conversion factors used and the total commodity volume in the original
unit (column 10)
• This column is only presented if “Yes” is selected in column 8 “Did you convert the total
commodity volume from another unit to metric tons?”.
• State the total commodity volume in the original unit before converting to metric tons. If the
volume was in multiple units, differentiate the volume for each unit in your answer.
• Provide details on the method used to convert your total commodity volume.
• State the conversion factor that was used to convert your total commodity volume into metric
tons. Where possible provide details on how this conversion factor was calculated or what the
conversion factor was based on.
Form of commodity (column 11)
• Select all the forms of commodity that apply. For example, a manufacturer of personal products
may use both palm oil derivatives and palm kernel oil derivatives.
• If you are reporting on embedded soy, select “Embedded soy” as the form of commodity.
% of procurement spend (column 12)
• This figure should be the percentage of procurement spend on the different forms of the
commodity as a percentage of total sourcing across your organization, to give an indication
of relative spend.
• CDP expects all responding organizations to provide this estimation. For organizations that
are only producers, however, this information may not be relevant. If an estimation of
procurement spend is not applicable for your business activity, select “Not applicable” in this
column.
% of revenue dependent on commodity (column 13)
• If you are producer/processor, “dependent” here refers to the percentage of the revenue
associated with the total production of the actual commodity.
• If you are manufacturer/retailer, “dependent” here refers to the percentage of the revenue
associated with the derivative/product containing the commodity.
• If you are a trader, “dependent” can refer to any and all of the above.
• If your organization does not measure the revenue dependent on the commodity, you may
provide an estimate.
Is this commodity considered significant to your business in terms of revenue? (column 14)
Page 42 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net

• Considering your revenue selection in column 13 “% of revenue dependent on this
agricultural commodity” and any other contextual factors, indicate whether this commodity is
considered significant to your business in terms of revenue.
• Use column 18 “Please explain” to describe your approach to determining a commodity’s
significance to your business.
Completion date of acquisition or merger (column 16)
• This column is presented if you selected “Recent acquisition or merger” in column 15 “Reason
for not disclosing”.
Explanation for not disclosing (column 17)
• This column only appears if you indicated in the questionnaire setup that you produced and/or
sourced this commodity but stated that you will not be disclosing on it.
• Provide further details on the reasons for not disclosing information on the commodity that you
produced and/or sourced.
Please explain (column 18)
• Briefly describe how you determine whether an agricultural commodity is significant to your
organization in terms of revenue, as reported in column 14 “Is this commodity considered
significant to your business in terms of revenue?”. Include any thresholds and additional
indicators beyond revenue.
• If you selected “Not applicable” in column 12 “% of procurement spend”, you may provide an
explanation.
Additional • For further information on volume reporting, refer to [Link to new technote - Pending]
information • The table below provides further details on the forms of the commodities considered in the
questionnaire:
Commodity Explanation
Timber This includes all solid timber as well as products made from processed wood fiber
products such as paper, packaging, cardboard and specialty fibers, e.g., viscose. It also
includes timber products used for biomass.
Palm oil This includes crude palm oil, palm kernel oil, and all of its derivatives. Please note
that palm oil used for biofuel production is also included in this category.
Cattle This includes all food products containing beef, all clothing, furniture and accessories
products that are made of leather, tallow, and all other products derived from cattle. Please
note that tallow used for biofuel production is also included in this category. Dairy
products are not included in this category.
Soy This includes whole soybean, soybean oil, soybean meal, and all of its derivatives.
Please note, that soy, which has been embedded as animal feed in animal products
e.g., meat, farmed fish, dairy, eggs, or other animal products as ingredients, as well
as soy used for biofuel production is also included in this category.
• For information on how to identify your organization’s exposure to embedded soy within its
value chain, you can use the “Soy Measurement Ladder” by the Consumer Goods Forum
(CGF) to assess the products that you source. The “Soy Measurement Ladder” groups
products into five tiers, and each tier contains groupings of similar products where soy usage
appears at the same point in the value chain. Tiers 2 to 5 include product groupings that are
applicable to embedded soy users, and Tier 1 only applies to direct soy users (CGF, 2016).
Differentiation of the metric ton, short ton and long ton:
• Metric ton (1000kg) – Alternative reference: metric tonne, tonne.
• Short ton (907kg) – Alternative reference: US ton, ton.
• Long ton (1016kg) – Alternative reference: Imperial ton/tonne.

General
content
• When answering this question, consider the dependency of your revenue on agricultural
commodities that your organization either produces and/or sources. Further questions
relating to these commodities will be presented.
• You should indicate if you produce and/or source each commodity, even if you do not
consider them to be water intensive, carbon intensive, or highly dependent on natural
capital.
• Revenue has been chosen as the unique metric to express business dependency, as it is
already calculated by many organizations and provides a clear message to investors about
an organization's financial dependency. CDP acknowledges that this metric may have
caveats, including the effects of yearly fluctuations in currency, which could represent a
challenge to disclosers. However, establishing a standard metric helps data users evaluate
and compare various organizations.
Agricultural commodities (column 0)
• If you produce or source a commodity that isn’t listed in column 0, indicate this in the “Other
commodity” row and specify the name of the commodity produced or sourced by your
organization in the “Please explain” column.
• Note for Forests disclosers: Commodities already disclosed in 1.22 do not need to be
disclosed on again in this question.
Page 45 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net

% of revenue dependent on this agricultural commodity (column 2)
• This column is only presented if you select “Produced”, “Sourced”, or “Produced and
sourced” in column 1 “Produced and/or sourced” for a specific commodity.
• If your organization does not measure the revenue associated with the produced and/or
sourced agricultural commodities reported, you may provide an estimate and explain this in
the “Please explain” column.
Is this commodity considered significant to your business in terms of revenue? (column 3)
• This column is only presented if you select “Produced”, “Sourced”, or “Produced and
sourced” in column 1 “Produced and/or sourced” for a specific commodity.
• Considering your revenue selection in column 2 “% of revenue dependent on this agricultural
commodity” and any other contextual factors, indicate whether this commodity is considered
significant to your business in terms of revenue.
• Use the “Please explain” column to describe your approach to determining a commodity’s
significance to your business.
Please explain (column 4)
• Provide details on how the “% of revenue dependent on this agricultural commodity" in
column 2 was calculated. Specify if there are any exclusions and the rationale for such
exclusions.
• Briefly describe how you determine whether an agricultural commodity is significant to your
organization in terms of revenue, as reported in column 3 “Is this commodity considered
significant to your business in terms of revenue?”. Include any thresholds and additional
indicators beyond revenue.
• If disclosing on water, state whether a given crop commodity is rainfed or irrigated, or in what
proportion.
• If your organization does not produce or source any of the commodities listed in column 0
and you used the “Other commodity” row to report a different commodity, use this space to
describe the commodity and explain why it has been included, e.g., because it is revenue
significant and accounts for a high proportion of your water demand.

content • Organizations may have multiple value chains related to different commodities or products.
This question requests organizations to consider their upstream (e.g. suppliers’) and
downstream (e.g. customers’) activities across all their value chains as an organization-wide
value chain.
• If disclosing on forests, note that "value chain mapping" (the process of identifying
stakeholders within your value chain, including where they operate and how they relate to
each other) is related to but distinct from "traceability" (the ability to follow products through
stages of the value chain). You can report details of your commodity traceability levels in
question 8.8.
• If you are a financial services discloser, select “Portfolio” in column 2 “Value chain stages
covered in mapping” when referring to the companies and/or activities within your portfolio
that you lend to, invest in, or insure. This question asks whether you are aware of the different
parts of your portfolio, where the companies operate and how they relate to each other.
Highest supplier tier mapped (column 3)
• This column only appears if "Upstream value chain" is selected in column 2 “Value chain
stages covered in mapping".
• Select the highest supplier tier you have mapped or are currently mapping relating to any
product or commodity across your portfolio.
• "Highest" in the context of supplier tiers refers to the furthest tier away from your direct
suppliers.
Smallholder inclusion in mapping (column 4)
• This column appears if "Upstream value chain" is selected in column 2 "Value chain stages
covered in mapping".
• Select "Smallholders relevant and included" if your organization sources from smallholders
and they are included in your upstream value chain mapping.
• Smallholders that you engage with but do not source from can also be relevant to your value
chain if your engagement proves to be mutually beneficial to the smallholders and your
organization (i.e., through providing benefits and positive incentives to smallholders while
enabling your organization to fulfil its supply chain commitments and secure adequate
volumes of responsibly produced commodities).
o If you consider smallholders that you do not source from relevant to your value chain
and include them in your value chain mapping, select "Smallholders relevant and
included".
o If they are relevant but not included in your value chain mapping, and neither are any
of the smallholders you source from, select "Smallholders relevant but not included".
Description of mapping process and coverage (column 7)
• Provide a description of your organization’s mapping process, including, for example:
o The type of information that has been collected;
o The tools and methods used; and
o The coverage of your mapping (i.e., whether it is full or partial).

(1.24.1) Have you mapped where in your direct operations or elsewhere in your value chain plastics
are produced, commercialized, used, and/or disposed of?
Question details
Question Your response to this question determines which questions will be shown throughout the
dependencies questionnaire and which response options will be listed within these questions. If your
response to 1.24.1 is amended, data in those dependent questions may be erased.
Change from last Modified question (2023 W10.1)
year
Rationale Mapping plastics in the value chain is the first step for organizations to increase awareness
of how plastics are produced, commercialized, used, and disposed of. This allows
organizations to understand their plastics-related impacts on the environment and
society, their exposure to plastics-related business risks, and how to reduce plastic
waste and pollution. Information on plastics mapping gives data users confidence in the
accuracy and thoroughness of information reported on plastics impacts, risks, targets,
and other metrics.
Ambition Organizations map the role of plastics in their revenue generation across their value chain,
understand the end-of-life management of the plastic and work towards managing their waste
in line with the waste hierarchy.

content • For each commodity that your organization sources, this question requests the
percentage of suppliers mapped per supplier tier in your commodity’s upstream
value chain.
• Note that “value chain mapping” (the process of identifying stakeholders within your
value chain, including where they operate and how they relate to each other) is
distinct from “traceability” (the ability to follow products through stages of the value
chain). You can report details of your traceability in 8.8.
Highest supplier tiers mapped for the sourced commodity (column 2)
• This column only appears if “Yes” is selected in column 1 “Value chain mapped for
this sourced commodity”.
• For each of your sourced commodities, indicate the highest supplier tier for which
you have mapped any number of suppliers. If your mapping exercise only includes
some of your suppliers within a tier, you should still select this tier. For example, if
you have mapped 100% of tier 1 suppliers, 50% of tier 2, and 0% of tier 3 and
beyond, then select “Tier 2”. You will then be able to indicate the percentage for
each tier mapped in the following columns.
• “Highest” in the context of supplier tiers refers to the furthest tier away from your
direct suppliers.
% of tier 1/tier 2/tier 3/tier 4+ suppliers mapped (columns 3-6)
Page 51 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net

• The appearance of these columns is dependent on your selections in column 2
“Highest supplier tier mapped for this sourced commodity”. i.e., if you select “Tier 2”
as the highest supplier tier mapped in column 2 “Highest supplier tiers mapped for
the sourced commodity”, you will only be shown columns to report the percentage
of suppliers mapped for tier 1 and 2.
• For each tier mapped, provide an estimated percentage of your total suppliers
included in the mapping.
Highest supplier tier known but not mapped for this sourced commodity (column 7)
• This column appears if anything other than “Tier 4+” selected in column 2 “Highest
supplier tiers mapped for the sourced commodity”.
• Select the highest tier that your organization is aware of in any of your commodity-
related value chains.
• This column gathers information on the supplier tiers in your organization’s
commodity-related upstream value chains. This does not refer to the highest tier that
you have mapped necessarily, i.e., you may be aware that you have tier 4+
suppliers, but not have carried out any mapping exercises to collect information
about these suppliers.
• Select “All supplier tiers known have been mapped” if you have mapped or are in
the process of mapping all known supplier tiers. You should only select this if you
know you do not have any additional tiers in your upstream value chains beyond
those reported as mapped.
Additional • For more information on how the concepts of “value chain mapping” and “traceability”

Module 2: Identification, assessment, and management of
dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities introduction
Page 52 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net

Guidance for companies reporting on Climate change, Forests, Water Security, Plastics and Biodiversity on
behalf of investors & supply chain members.
The full reporting guidance including explanation of terms is available via the portal/public guidance page.
Module overview
Module This module requests information about the time horizons at which organizations consider
Overview environmental issues, how an organization defines what is a substantive effect on its business, the
procedures that organizations have in place to identify, assess and manage their environmental-
related dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities relevant to their sector, and the
identification of priority locations.
For organizations disclosing on water security, this module also requests information about the
procedures that organizations have in place to manage water pollutants (section 2.5) and questions
focused on tailings dams management targeted at specific sectors only (section 2.6).
These procedures are considered important to addressing environmental issues independent of an
organization’s own perception or an assessment of any associated net risk for their organizations.
This is why CDP asks organizations to answer these questions before disclosing whether they
consider themselves exposed to environmental related risks and/or opportunities and what these
are.
This information provides data users with confidence that the risks and opportunities disclosed in
Module 3 (Disclosure of Risks and Opportunities) are comprehensive.
Sector-specific
• Additional questions on identifying, assessing, and managing biodiversity impacts and
content dependencies related to portfolio activities, assessment process and tailings dams
management procedures for the following high-impact sectors: Financial services, Metals &
Minning, and Coal, and for organisations with mining projects.
• Additional response options presented in 2.2, 2.2.1, and 2.2.2 for organizations with mining

sectors could hinder organizations’ consideration of the environmental risks and opportunities
specific to their businesses.
• TCFD and TNFD do not define timeframes and encourage respondents to decide how to
define their own timeframes considering the useful life of their assets or infrastructure, the
profile of the environmental risks they face, the sectors and geographies in which they
operate, and that environmental risks and opportunities can manifest themselves over the
medium and long term.
• In assessing environmental issues, organizations should be sensitive to the timeframe used to
conduct their assessments. While many organizations conduct operational and financial
planning over a 1–2-year timeframe, and strategic and capital planning over a 2-5-year
timeframe, environmental risks and opportunities may have implications over a longer period.
It is therefore important for organizations to consider the appropriate timeframes when
assessing environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities.

environmental dependencies and/or impacts?
Question details
Change from last New question for Climate change, Forests and Water
year
Modified question for Plastics and Biodiversity (2023 W10.2, C15.3, F-MM10.1/F-CO10.1)
Rationale Dependencies and impacts on the environment can result in changes to the capacity of nature
to provide social and economic functions. Additionally, it is essential to identify, assess, and
manage dependencies and impacts on the environment in order to assess effectively the risks
and opportunities of an organization. This question allows data users to gauge the
organization’s awareness of its own environmental dependencies and impacts.
Ambition • The organization has a robust process to identify, assess, and manage environmental
dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities across its direct operations, value chain,
financed activities, and assets.

Ambition • The organization has a robust process to identify, assess, and manage environmental
dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities across its direct operations, value chain,
financed activities, and assets.
• The organization maps its value chain, screens sites, and engages stakeholders to identify
and assess environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities. This is
integrated into a multi-disciplinary organization-wide risk management, covers transition and
physical risks/opportunities over different timeframes, and discloses methods and
significance criteria.
• The organization conducts the identification and assessment process at least once a year
and describes how data was obtained.
• The organization describes how the outputs from the scenario analysis are used in risk and
opportunity identification, assessment, and management processes, given the
organization’s activities and relevant timeframes.

Requested General
content • Organizations are requested to report information on their approach to evaluating their
dependencies and/or impacts on the environment, and consequently their approach to
assessing risks and/or opportunities that are identified through understanding their
dependencies and/or impacts
o This question seeks to capture a holistic overview of this process in its entirety.
o If your process is the same for multiple environmental issues, you may select all
that apply in column 1 “Environmental issue”.
o If your process differs for each environmental issue, add a new row and indicate
these differences accordingly. If there are minor differences between how
environmental issues are considered within your processes, you may use the text
fields to provide details of these differences.
o If you have multiple processes for the same environmental issue, for example if
the process differs for different stages of the value chain, you may add rows
accordingly. Alternatively, you may use the text fields to provide details of minor
differences between the processes.
Coverage (column 4)
• This column will be presented if “Direct operations”, “Upstream value chain” or “Downstream
value chain” is selected in column 3 “Value chain stages covered”.
• If certain elements of your direct operations, or other parts of your value chain are excluded
from the assessment process, select "Partial" and explain your reasons in column 16 “Further
details of process”.
Supplier tiers covered (column 5)
• This column will be presented if “Upstream value chain” is selected in column 3 “Value chain
stages covered”.
• The options in this column are dependent on the estimate of highest supplier tier mapped
provided in column 3 of 1.24 “Highest supplier tier mapped”.
• Select all options that represent the supplier tiers covered in your assessment process.
Type of assessment (column 7)
• Disclose whether the assessment is qualitative, quantitative, or both.
• Qualitative assessment is descriptive and may include stakeholder involvement, meetings,
interviews, and analysis of scenario impacts or descriptive risk matrices.
• Quantitative assessment is expressed in numbers and involves indicators, indices, variables,
and metrics such as probabilistic or stochastic risk modelling considering frequency and
severity of events.
Frequency of assessment (column 8)
• Select the option that best reflects the frequency that all dependencies, impacts, risks and/or
opportunities are assessed and/or reviewed.
o The frequency disclosed here does not necessarily mean the frequency you
complete a full assessment of all dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities.
For example, long-term risks may be relevant for several years and only require
periodic review. Therefore, you may select the option that best reflects the
frequency that all dependencies, impacts, risks and/or opportunities are assessed
and/or reviewed.
Time horizons covered (column 9)
• Choose all the time horizons that are considered in your assessment. For example, if you only
consider dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities relating to the environmental issue
selected in column 1 “Environmental issue” in the short term (in line with your definition of time
horizons provided in 2.1), you should select “short-term” here. Or, if you consider
dependencies, impacts, risks, and/or opportunities over short-term, medium-term, and long-
term time horizons, select all three.
Integration of risk management process (column 10)
• This column only appears if you select “Risks” in column 2 “Indicate which of dependencies,
impacts, risks, and opportunities are covered by the process”.
Page 63 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net

• Select the option that best describes how your process for identifying, assessing, and
managing risks is integrated into your overall assessment framework.
o Integrated into multi-disciplinary organization-wide risk management
process: a documented process where risks are identified and assessed in an
integrated way in the company’s centralized enterprise risk management program
covering all possible types/sources of risks.
o A specific environmental risk management process: a documented process
that identifies, assesses, and manages risks separately from other business risks.
Location-specificity used (column 11)
• Site-specific: the assessment process is conducted within the sites that your organization
and/or its suppliers operate in, or any other relevant operational sites.
• Local: the assessment process is conducted within a defined area below sub-national level
(e.g., cities, towns, villages).
• Sub-national: the assessment process is conducted within a defined area below
country/area-level. This may include the immediate landscape that operational sites sit within
and could impact, or defined political boundaries (e.g., state, province, district, municipality).
• National: the assessment process is conducted across entire countries/areas. It does not
consider dependencies, impact, risks, and/or opportunities that are specific to local areas or
sites.
Risk types and criteria considered (columns 13a, 13b)
• This column only appears if you select “Risks” in column 2 “Indicate which of dependencies,
impacts, risks, and opportunities are covered by the process”.
• Select all options that best represent the types of risk considered in the assessment process,
whether a risk is subsequently identified or not:
o Acute physical– occurrence of short term, specific events that change the state of
the environment. For example, cyclones, oil spills, forest fires or pests affecting a
harvest;
o Chronic physical – gradual changes to the state of the environment. For example,
pollution stemming from pesticide use or sea level rise driven by climate change.
o Policy – changes in the policy context due to new (or enforcement of existing)
policies to create positive impacts on the environment or mitigate negative impacts
on the environment;
o Technology – substitution of products or services with a reduced impact on the
environment and/or reduced dependency on the environment. For example, the
replacement of plastics with biodegradable containers;
o Market – changing dynamics in overall markets, including changes in consumer
preferences, which arise from changing physical, regulatory, technological and
reputational conditions and stakeholder dynamics. For example, the market value
of a company is affected by assets that have decreased in value because there is
insufficient freshwater for the production process, or the value of the business’
production process is reduced by the emergence of new technologies that require
less water to operate;
o Reputation – changes in perception concerning an organization’s actual or
perceived environmental impacts, including at the local, economic and societal
level. This can result from direct company impacts, industry impacts and/or
impacts of activities upstream and/or downstream in a value chain;
o Liability – liability risks that arise directly or indirectly from legal claims. As laws,
regulations and case law related to an organization’s preparedness for nature
action evolves, the incident or probability of contingent liabilities arising from an
organization may increase.
Further details of process (column 16)
• Describe your process for identifying, assessing, and managing dependencies, impacts, risks,
and/or opportunities, including:
o If relevant to your selections in 2.2, an assessment of how your organization’s
dependencies and/or impacts inform your assessment of your organization’s risks
and/or opportunities.
Page 64 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net

o The proportion of operational locations assessed (screening site locations,
business activities and assets within value chain to identify dependencies, impacts,
risks, and/or opportunities).
o The methodology/data sources used for key data not obtained directly from the
organization's operations.
o Describes how your process for identifying, assessing, and managing
dependencies, impacts, and/or opportunities is integrated into your company-wide
risk management process.
• Describe the process used to determine which risks and/or opportunities could have a
substantive financial or strategic effect on the organization, and which dependencies and/or
impacts are relevant to this, including:
o The methodology used to assess the nature, likelihood, and magnitude of the
effects of dependencies, impacts, risks, and/or opportunities (including qualitative

Rationale Assessing biodiversity impacts before the development of a mining project as part of an
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) improves decision making and resource allocation, as
well as helping to avoid costs associated with unforeseen issues. Indicating how your projects
have gone through such assessment before the project development stage provides evidence to
data users that biodiversity impacts have been considered before implementation of the project.

portfolio activities.
Question details
Question This question only appears if you select “Yes” in response to column 1 ”Process in place
dependencies covering this portfolio” of 2.2.4 or 2.2.5,.
A row will appear in this table for each portfolio for which you selected “Yes” in column 1
“Process in place covering this portfolio” to 2.2.4 or 2.2.5.
Change from last New question for Plastics and Biodiversity
year Modified question (2023 C-FS2.2c, FW-FS2.1a)
Rationale Financial institutions that have established a comprehensive, recurring procedure to identify,
assess, and manage environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities across all
their portfolios and over a range of time-horizons will be better equipped to handle longer-term
uncertainties and liabilities, as well as capitalize on opportunities. This question indicates to
data users how robust a financial institution’s assessment process is.
Ambition • The financial institution has a robust process to identify, assess, and manage environmental
dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities across all of its portfolios.
• The financial institution maps its portfolios and engages stakeholders to identify and assess
environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities. This is integrated into a multi-
disciplinary portfolio-wide risk management, covers transition and physical risks/opportunities
over different timeframes, and discloses methods and significance criteria.
• Financial institutions include the value of their total assets and the proportion to which the
identification, assessment and management process and environmental strategy apply.
• The financial institution conducts the identification and assessment process at least once a
year, describing how data was obtained, and evaluates the linkages between assessing
dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities.
• The financial institution describes how the outputs from the scenario analysis are used in risk
and opportunity identification, assessment, and management processes, given the
organization’s activities and relevant timeframes.

Requested General
content • For each portfolio in column 0 “Portfolio”, financial institutions are requested to report
information on their approach to evaluating their dependencies and/or impacts on the
environment, and consequently their approach to assessing risks and/or opportunities in
their lending, financial intermediary, investment and/or insurance underwriting activities,
that are identified through understanding its their dependencies and/or impacts.
o This question seeks to capture a holistic overview of this process in its entirety.
o If your process is the same for multiple environmental issues, you may select all
that apply in column 1 “Environmental issue”.
o If your process differs for each environmental issue, add a new row and indicate
these differences accordingly. If there are minor differences between how
Page 75 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net

environmental issues are considered within your processes, you may use the text
fields to provide details of these differences.
o If you have multiple processes for the same environmental issue, for example if
the process differs for different stages of the value chain, you may add rows
accordingly. Alternatively, you may use the text fields to provide details of minor
differences between the processes.
Portfolio (column 0)
• The rows presented in this table depend on your response to 2.2.4 and 2.2.5
• Respond to all rows individually.
% of portfolio covered by the assessment process in relation to total portfolio value (column 3)
• For each of your portfolios, disclose the percentage of portfolio value covered by the
assessment process to the portfolio value based on assets value reported in 1.10.
Type of assessment (column 4)
• Disclose whether the assessment is qualitative, quantitative, or both.
• Qualitative assessment is descriptive and may include stakeholder involvement, meetings,
interviews, and analysis of scenario impacts or descriptive risk matrices.
• Quantitative assessment is expressed in numbers and involves indicators, indices, variables
and metrics such as probabilistic or stochastic risk modelling considering frequency and
severity of events.
Frequency of assessment (column 6)
• Select the option that best reflects the frequency that all dependencies, impacts, risks and/or
opportunities are assessed and/or reviewed.
o The frequency disclosed here does not necessarily mean the frequency you
complete a full assessment of all dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities.
For example, long-term risks may be relevant for several years and only require
periodic review. Therefore, you may select the option that best reflects the
frequency that all dependencies, impacts, risks and/or opportunities are assessed
and/or reviewed.
Time horizons covered (column 7)
Choose all the time horizons that are considered in your assessment. For example, if you only
consider dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities relating to the portfolio in column 0
“Portfolio” in the short term (in line with your definition of time horizons provided in 2.1), you should
select “short-term” here. Or, if you consider, short-term, medium-term and long-term time horizons,
select all three.
Integration of risk management process (column 8)
• This column only appears if you select “Risks” in column 2 “Indicate which of dependencies,
impacts, risks, and opportunities are covered by the process”.
• Select the option that best describes how your process for identifying, assessing, and
managing risks related to the portfolio in column 0 “Portfolio” is integrated into your overall
assessment framework.
o Integrated into multi-disciplinary organization-wide risk management processes: a
documented process where risks related to the portfolio in column 0 “Portfolio” are
identified and assessed in an integrated way in the company’s centralized
enterprise risk management program covering all possible types/sources of risks.
o A specific environmental risk management process: a documented process that
identifies, assesses, and manages risks related to the portfolio in column 0
“Portfolio” separately from other business risks.
Location-specificity used (column 9)
• Site-specific: the assessment process is conducted within the sites that your organization
and/or its suppliers operate in, or any other relevant operational sites.
• Local: the assessment process is conducted within a defined area below sub-national level
(e.g., cities, towns, villages).
Page 76 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net

• Sub-national: the assessment process is conducted within a defined area below
country/area-level. This may include the immediate landscape that operational sites sit
within and could impact, or defined political boundaries (e.g., state, province, district,
municipality).
• National: the assessment process is conducted across entire countries/areas. It does not
consider dependencies, impact, risks, and/or opportunities that are specific to local areas
or sites.
Tools and methods used (column 10)
• Select which tools and methodologies you use to assess your portfolio’s exposure to
environmental risks:
o UNEP FI Portfolio Impact Analysis Tool for Banks: helps banks analyze the
impacts associated with their retail (consumer and business banking) and wholesale
(corporate and investment banking) portfolios.
o UNEP FI Corporate Impact Analysis Tool: enables users to perform a holistic
analysis of companies, based on the reality of those companies’ business activities
and the needs of the countries in which they operate, whether for sourcing,
production, or sales.
o 2DII Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA) tool: portfolio-level
analysis for equities and fixed income climate transition risks in power and some
industrial sectors (cement and steel).
o The Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI): bottom-up assessment of how listed
companies are preparing for the transition to a low-carbon economy.
o 2 Degrees of Separation: In-depth sector and company-level analysis of oil and gas
companies’ upstream exposure to climate transition risks.
o Portfolio temperature alignment: portfolio alignment tools are used to generate
metrics to determine the overall level of alignment of a portfolio, by assessing the
performance of its individual companies.
o Risk models: computerized systems, such as catastrophe models, used to assess
and quantify the financial impact of a range of potential future disasters.
o Scenario analysis: considers how an organization is impacted by changes to
policy/regulation, technology or market changes aimed at emissions reductions,
energy efficiency, subsidies/taxes or other constraints or incentives implemented to
facilitate a low carbon economy (for example, the ‘well below 2°C’ goal committed to
by the Paris Agreement). Assesses the impact of acute or chronic physical change
related to climate change such extreme weather, rising sea levels, water shortage,
etc.
o Stress tests: process of evaluating a number of statistically defined possibilities to
determine the most damaging combination of events, and the loss they would
produce. The likelihood of such an event is then assessed.
o Corporate Bonds Water Credit Risk Tool (Water Credit Risk Tool): enables users
to integrate financial risk exposure to water scarcity into standard financial models
used to assess the credit strengths of corporates across water-intensive sectors
including power utilities, beverages and mining.
o Drought Stress Testing Tool: allows financial institutions to see how incorporating
drought scenarios changes the perception of risk in their own loan portfolios, based on
the catastrophe modelling framework (UNEP).
o ENCORE: identifies business risks arising from economic dependencies on natural
capital (NCFA, Global Canopy, UN).
o Environmental Justice Atlas: documents and catalogues social conflict around
environmental issues.
o Global Forests Watch Pro: delivers critical decision-making analysis at the property,
supply shed and portfolio levels.
o Investor Water Toolkit: supports the evaluation of water risks in investment
portfolios, and includes links to other resources, data bases, case studies and tools
(Ceres).
o Risk models: computerized systems, such as catastrophe models, used to assess
and quantify the financial impact of a range of potential future disasters.

o Stress tests: process of evaluating a number of statistically defined possibilities to
determine the most damaging combination of events, and the loss they would
produce. The likelihood of such an event is then assessed.
o Sustainability Policy Transparency Toolkit (SPOTT): supports the finance sector
and supply chain stakeholders to manage environmental, social and governance
(ESG) risks by publishing transparency assessments of soft commodity producers
and traders.
o Trase Finance: enables financial institutions to understand and mitigate their
exposure to deforestation in their portfolios and allow civil society and governments to
better hold to account those failing to act.

Risk type and criteria considered (columns 11a, 11b)
• This column only appears if you select “Risks” in column 1 “Indicate which of dependencies,
impacts, risks, and opportunities are covered by the process for this portfolio”.
• Select the option that best represents the types of risk considered in your assessment
process, having the following in mind:
o Acute physical – occurrence of short term, specific events that change the state of
nature. For example, oil spills, forest fires or pests affecting a harvest;
o Chronic physical – gradual changes to the state of nature. For example, pollution
stemming from pesticide use or climate change.
o Policy – changes in the policy context due to new (or enforcement of existing)
policies to create positive impacts on nature or mitigate negative impacts on nature;
o Technology – Substitution of products or services with a reduced impact on nature
and/or reduced dependency on nature. For example, the replacement of plastics
with biodegradable containers;
o Market – Changing dynamics in overall markets, including changes in consumer
preferences, which arise from changing physical, regulatory, technological and
reputational conditions and stakeholder dynamics. For example, the market value
of a company is affected by assets that have decreased in value because there is
insufficient freshwater for the production process, or the value of the business’
production process is reduced by the emergence of new technologies that require
less water to operate;
o Reputation – Changes in perception concerning an organization’s actual or
perceived nature impacts, including at the local, economic and societal level. This
can result from direct company impacts, industry impacts and/or impacts of
activities upstream and/or downstream in a value chain.
o Liability – Liability risks that arise directly or indirectly from legal claims. As laws,
regulations and case law related to an organization’s preparedness for nature
action evolves, the incident or probability of contingent liabilities arising from an
organization may increase.

fed into your assessment of your risks and/or opportunities.
o Explain how you defined and calculated the proportion of portfolio covered by your
risk management process and if the assessment included systemic and sector
risks.
o Consideration of existing/emerging regulatory requirements (e.g., restrictions on
water or land use).

Rationale Nature-related disclosures should be integrated with other business and sustainability-related
disclosures, whenever possible, to provide report users with an integrated and holistic picture of
the organization’s financial position and prospects. Integration of climate- and nature-related
disclosures is of particular importance. It is important that any alignment, synergies,
contributions and possible trade-offs between climate and nature are clearly identified. This
question demonstrates that assessing the interconnections between environmental
dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities is part of the organization’s assessment
process.

Priority locations
Section overview
Page 86 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net

Section This section requests information on your organization’s “priority locations”. These are locations
Overview where your organization’s activities across the value chain interact with nature, and that your
organization has prioritized for action due to certain characteristics that increase their
vulnerability. This section has been incorporated into the CDP questionnaire to align with the
Task Force for Nature related Disclosure (TNFD) ‘Strategy D’. This is a key concept of the TNFD
but is also part of other frameworks and standards such as the SBTN and ESRS. TNFD
guidance recommends that an organization discloses its full list of priority locations under
recommended disclosure strategy D.
(2.3) Have you identified priority locations across your value chain?
Question details
Change from last New question
year
Rationale To effectively address nature-related issues and to ensure operational stability, organizations
should prioritize their attention in or near areas with ecosystems whose current and future
health and resilience are challenged. Identifying and prioritizing locations in or near areas with
ecological sensitivity, as well as areas where the organization has substantive dependencies,
impacts, risks, and opportunities related to nature allows the organization to focus on areas
where action is needed most urgently, maximizing the potential for positive impacts.
Ambition
• The organization identifies where in its direct operations and value chain it has activities in:
o Sensitive locations: Locations where the activities in its direct operations – and,
where possible upstream and downstream value chain – interface with nature in:
▪ Areas important for biodiversity; and/or
▪ Areas of high ecosystem integrity; and/or
▪ Areas of rapid decline in ecosystem integrity; and/or
▪ Areas of limited water availability, flooding, and/or poor quality of water;
and/or
▪ Areas of importance for ecosystem service provision.
and/or
o Locations with substantive dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities:
locations where an organization has identified substantive nature-related
dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities in its direct operations, and

Requested General
content
• “Priority locations” are locations where your organization’s activities across the value chain
have interfaces with nature, which your organization has prioritized for action due to
certain characteristics that increase their vulnerability.
• Locations could be prioritized either because they are in or near ecologically sensitive
locations, e.g. in areas that are important for biodiversity; and/or because the organization
has identified substantive nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities
in these locations.
Description of process to identify priority locations (column 4)
• Outline your organization’s process to identify priority locations in each value chain stage,
with reference to your wider assessment process as reported in 2.2.2 if applicable. For
example:
o state the tools, data sources, and indicators and metrics used;
o briefly describe your approach to determine whether the dependencies, impacts,
risks, and/or opportunities in a location are substantive; and
o specify the thresholds used to define an area as a type of sensitive location.
• Refer to the level of geographic specificity achieved. If priority locations have been
aggregated, explain how, and provide the reasons for aggregating.
• If relevant, briefly describe any plans to improve your process for identifying priority
locations in the future.
Page 88 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net

Provide a list and/or spatial map of priority locations (column 6)
• This column is only presented if you select “Yes” in column 5 “Will you be disclosing a
list/spatial map of priority locations?”
• Attach a list and/or spatial map of the locations in your direct operations and/or
upstream/downstream value chain stages:
o that are in or near to sensitive locations; and
o where substantive nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and/or
opportunities have been identified, specifying whether any of these locations also
meet the criteria for sensitive locations.
• You may include an ID number per priority location in case it would be desirable for your
organization to reference them throughout your CDP disclosure.
• For further guidance on priority locations, you can find additional information on the TNFD
website.
Explain why you do not identify priority locations (column 8)
• This column is only presented if you select either “No…” option in column 1 “Identification
of priority locations”.
• Briefly describe the reasons for not having identified priority locations and any plans to do
so in the future.
Additional
More about ‘priority locations’
information
“Priority locations” is a concept mainly promoted by the TNFD recommendations and LEAP
approach, but also encountered in other frameworks and standards such as SBTN and ESRS. The
TNFD disclosure guidance recommends that an organization discloses the full list of priority
locations (i.e., a list of all locations that meet at least one of the “Priority locations” criteria) under
recommended disclosure Strategy D. This applies even if organizations choose to apply further
prioritization criteria.
According to the TNFD, the concept of “priority locations” is based on the premise that organizations
are more likely to face nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities in locations
with certain characteristics. An organization should bear in mind that this prioritization is part of an
iterative process, with location prioritization guiding the assessment of dependencies, impacts, risks,
and opportunities and vice versa.
WWF tools to assess for ‘priority locations’
The WWF Water Risk Filter and the WWF Biodiversity Risk Filter are accepted tools to assess
sensitive locations as defined by the TNFD.
(Additional information continued…)
WWF Water Risk Filter • Areas important for biodiversity: when either of the following reputational risk
indicators are equal to/greater than ‘High risk’: 3.4: ‘Freshwater Endemism’,
‘Freshwater Biodiversity Richness’, or ‘Ramsar Wetlands’. WWF recommends that
users also take into consideration locations facing ‘Medium risk’ >2.6.
• Areas of rapid decline in ecosystem integrity: when the physical risk category
‘Ecosystem Services Status’ and associated indicators are equal to/greater than
‘High risk’: 3.4. WWF recommends that users also take into consideration locations
facing ‘Medium risk’: >2.6.
• Areas of limited water availability, flooding, and/or poor quality of water:
o Limited water availability: when the physical risk category ‘Water
Availability’ is equal to/greater than ‘High risk’: 3.4. WWF recommends that
users also take into consideration locations facing ‘Medium risk’ >2.6;
o Flooding: when the physical risk category ‘Flooding’ is equal to/greater than
‘High risk’: 3.4. WWF recommends that users also take into consideration
locations facing ‘Medium risk’ >2.6;
Page 89 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net

o Poor quality of water: when the physical risk category ‘Water Quality’ is

Rationale
Indicators and thresholds employed to define which effects on the organization are considered
substantive can differ among disclosers depending on their sector, value chain, or geography.
Therefore, outlining clear definitions on how organizations determine potential effects as
substantive provides critical context to data users. This question increases transparency and
improves clarity as to what the discloser deems to be a substantive effect on their organization.

Requested General
content • This question seeks to define and quantify how your organization defines a ‘substantive
effect’ on your organization at the corporate level, in the context of environmental risks
and opportunities. This will be used to understand the threshold for your reported risks
and opportunities in 3.1 and 3.6.
• What constitutes a substantive effect will vary between organizations. You are
therefore asked to determine ‘substantive’ in the way that you would do for your
business decision-making. For example, a 1% reduction in profits will have different
effects on different organizations depending on its respective profit margins. A
substantive effect of relatively high magnitude could occur because of a large impact
on one of the following aspects, or because of a small number for all three combines
to create a larger effect:
o the proportion of business units affected;
o the size of the effect on those business units;
o the dependency of the organization on that unit; and/or
o the potential for shareholder or customer concern.
• Use the “Add row” function if you define a substantive effect on your organization with
respect to risks or opportunities in more than one way. For example, if you use
multiple indicators or have different definitions for different parts of the business.
Metrics considered in definition (column 7)
• This column seeks to capture the different factors taken into account when defining a
substantive effect on your organization with respect to risks and opportunities.
• If you have provided a quantitative definition, these metrics could give further context
to your quantitative indicator. For example, you may define risks to be substantive if
they could lead to a 10% decrease in revenue over your short-term time horizon (as
defined in 2.1). In this case, select “Time horizon over which the effect occurs” and
provide further details in column 8 “Application of definition”.
• If you are only providing a qualitative definition, select all relevant metrics used to
define a substantive effect, or use “Other, please specify” to specify a different metric.
Application of definition (column 8)
• Describe the thresholds considered to be substantive for the metrics reported in
column 7 “Metrics considered in definition”. For example:
o Frequency of effect occurring: i.e. once, quarterly, every two years etc.
o Time horizon over which the effect occurs: i.e., short-, medium-, and long-
term in line with your time horizons reported in 2.1.
o Likelihood of effect occurring: i.e., the percentage chance the effect will occur
• Often, multiple metrics are used together as part of a matrix approach. If using a
matrix approach, describe how the metrics selected in column 7 “Metrics considered
in definition” are used in combination and their respective weightings.
• Describe how often the metrics, and their thresholds, are selected, reviewed, and
updated.

and/or any "Mining" option in column “Aspect” of 1.17.
Page 96 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net

Change from last year Revised question dependency (2023 W-MM3.2/W-CO3.2)
Rationale Ensuring the best management of tailings dams is a critical water-related issue for
organizations in the Metals & Mining and Coal sectors. Operational requirements and local
factors such as climate or landscape determine the dams’ type and design and
subsequently the risk level for this task. Active and inactive tailings dams pose different
risks, therefore requiring different management procedures.
These questions will demonstrate to data users that organizations understand these
issues, are assessing the risks associated, and are taking action to prevent them.
Disclosure on the locations and state of the tailings dams will allow data users to relate
this information to other responses in the CDP questionnaire that include
country/area/region and basin specific information in Module 9.

General
• There are a variety of guidelines for the evaluation of consequences of dams’ failure.
CDP does not prescribe any specific method.
Evaluation of the consequences of tailings dam failure (column 1)
• If you evaluate only a proportion of your facilities, select ”Yes” and use the last column
to provide additional information on the coverage.
• If you select any of the “No” options, then columns 2 and 3 will not be presented.
Page 100 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net

Evaluation/Classification guideline(s) (column 2)
• These may be recommendations or regulations from industry bodies or public
agencies, or your organization’s own framework.
• If you use a company-specific framework you may indicate this here and provide
further information on how you evaluate the potential consequences to human health
and the environment in the “Please explain” column.
Please explain (column 4)
• Provide any additional information to help data users interpret the details you have
provided on your evaluation and classification (even if no dams have been classified
as ‘hazardous’ or ‘highly hazardous’). For example:
The rationale of your choice of guidelines for the evaluation;
The minimum level used to classify a dam as ‘hazardous’. For example, “we follow the
ANCOLD framework, considering as ‘hazardous’ any dam classified as ‘High B’ or
above”;
For the use of company-specific frameworks, please explain how consequences are
evaluated;
The frequency that evaluations are revised; or
How the classifications inform the management procedures followed.
• If the evaluation does not cover all facilities, you should explain why this is the case
and any plans to extend coverage.
• If you have selected “No“ in column 1, you should explain why you do not carry out
such an evaluation, including any future plans to do so.
• Note: Information on your dams classified as ‘hazardous’ or ‘highly hazardous’ is
requested in 2.6.2.
Additional information
• The Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management strives to achieve the ultimate
goal of zero harm to people and the environment with zero tolerance for human
fatality. Underpinned by an integrated approach to tailings management, the Standard
aims to prevent catastrophic failure and enhance the safety of mine tailings facilities
across the globe. The global tailings review to establish this standard was co-
convened by the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), the Principles for
Responsible Investment (PRI) and the United Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP).
• The Canadian Dam Association Safety guidelines defines “consequences of failure”
as the impacts on the downstream or upstream area of a dam as a result of failure of
the dam or its appurtenances.

Question details
Question This question only appears if you select “Yes, tailings dams have been classified as ‘hazardous’ or ‘highly hazardous’ (or equivalent)” in
dependencies response to 2.6.1.
Change from last year No change (2023 W-MM3.2b/W-CO3.2b)
Rationale Providing details for ‘hazardous’ and ‘highly hazardous’ tailings dams demonstrates a commitment to transparency around the potentially
devastating consequences of tailings dam failures.
Despite the existence of a variety of categorization systems and guidelines for evaluating the consequences of dam failure to human health
and ecosystems, there is no standardized definition of what constitutes ‘Hazardous’ or ‘Highly hazardous’ tailings dams. Disclosing the
guidelines used together with the current and planned impoundment volumes will also demonstrate data users that a company is aware of the
potential risks and how this exposure may change in the near future.
Requesting information about the location of the dam will allow data users to relate this information to other responses in the CDP
questionnaire that include country/area and basin specific information.
The information requested in this question aligns with the request by the Investor Mining and Tailings Safety Initiative, Sustainability

Module 3: Disclosure of dependencies, risks, and
opportunities
Guidance for companies reporting on Climate change, Forests, Water Security, Biodiversity, Plastics on
behalf of investors & supply chain members.
The full reporting guidance including explanation of terms is available via the portal/public guidance page.
Module overview
Module This module allows organizations to demonstrate that they have a clear awareness of the extent to
Overview which they are exposed to environmental risks, and aligned with environmental opportunities, within
their direct operations and other parts of their value chain.
CDP asks organizations to report environmental risks which have had a substantive effect on the
organization in the reporting year, or are anticipated to have a substantive effect on the organization
in the future, and to share details of the potential effects of those risks and their associated
response strategies. Organizations are also requested to provide an indication of the extent of their
exposure to physical and transition risks.
This module also asks organizations to share any environmental opportunities which have had a
substantive effect on the organization in the reporting year or are anticipated to have a substantive
effect on the organization in the future, and the extent to which they are aligning their business with
environmental opportunities.
Providing information about inherent risk exposure rather than only the residual risk (remaining after
any response) allows data-users to consider the potential impact and the appropriateness of the
organization’s response.
You may wish to consult with your financial, legal, and/or compliance departments for advice on
your company’s general approach to the provision of forward-looking statements and information
concerning risks.
Note for financial services companies: TCFD recommendations highlight importance of the financial
sector considering the impacts of environmental issues in the context of their financing activities.
When evaluating exposure to risks and opportunities, financial services companies should consider
the impact on their lending, financial intermediary, investing and/or insurance underwriting activities,
in addition to operational activities.
Sector-specific

Risk disclosure
(3.1) Have you identified any environmental risks which have had a substantive effect on your
organization in the reporting year, or are anticipated to have a substantive effect on your
organization in the future?
Question details
Change from last Modified question (2023 C2.3, C2.3b, F1.6, F3.1, F3.1c, F-MM9.5/F-CO9.5, F-MM11.2/F-
year CO11.2, FW-FS2.3, W2.1, W4.1, W4.2b, W4.2c, W10.3).
Rationale It is crucial for investors and data users to understand your organization's risk exposure,
especially regarding any environmental risks across your value chain which are anticipated
to have substantive effects on your organization. This includes both risks which have
already had an effect within the reporting year and risks which may have an effect in the
future. If no environmental risks with substantive effects have been identified as part of your
assessment, it is equally crucial for data users to understand how and why you have
concluded that such risks are not anticipated to affect your organization.
Ambition • The organization discloses environmental risks which have had or are anticipated
to have a substantive effect on the organization’s strategy, business activities,
value chain, financial position (e.g., assets and liabilities), financial performance
(e.g., revenue or expenditure) and cash flows.

content
• For the purposes of this response, the environmental risks reported should be those
which:
o Have had or are anticipated to have a substantive effect on your organization,
in line with your definition of substantive effect provided in 2.4;
o Have had or are anticipated to have a substantive effect at the corporate level,
and not simply at the asset, business unit and/or geographic level where they
may occur; and
o Have had or are anticipated to have a substantive effect when considering the
inherent risk (existing in the absence of controls, i.e. not considering any
mitigation or management measures that have been or could be implemented)
as well as the residual risk (remaining after a specific action has been taken to
manage the risk).
• Your selection in column 1 “Environmental risks identified” will determine whether columns

risks in your direct operations and/or upstream/downstream value chain” and 3 “Please
explain” will be presented and drive the appearance of rows in question 5.3.
Environmental risks identified (column 1)
• Select the appropriate “Yes” option if any risks have been identified as having had or
having anticipated substantive effects before any response actions are accounted for.
Consider both the risks which have been accepted and those to which you are responding
when determining which option to select.
• Note for financial services companies: Select option “Yes, only within our direct operations
or upstream value chain” only if you have identified risks, but none of these relate to your
lending, investing, or insurance activities relating to your portfolio.
Please explain (column 3)
• This column is only presented if any option other than “Yes, both within our direct
operations…” is selected in column 1.
• Explain why your organization has concluded that it is not exposed to environmental risks.

CO11.2b, FW-FS2.3a, W2.1a, W4.2, W4.2a).
New question for Plastics
Rationale Your response to this question provides data users with an overview of the environmental
risks affecting your organization now and in the future. Information on the current and
anticipated financial effects of these risks, and your response strategy to manage and
mitigate them, are critical elements for guiding investments as well as implementing
corporate actions to improve business resilience and environmental stewardship.
Ambition The organization discloses environmental risks which have had or are anticipated to
have a substantive effect on the organization’s strategy, business activities, value chain,
financial position (e.g. assets and liabilities), financial performance (e.g., revenue or
expenditure) and cash flows. The disclosure per risk includes:
o The timeframe, likelihood and magnitude associated with the effects of
the risk,
o Current and anticipated effects on the value chain and where these risks
are located,
o Whether the risks are physical (acute or chronic) or transition risks
(policy, market, reputation, technology, liability),
o The current and anticipated financial effects of the risks,
o The costs of response to a risk, a description of the response and an
explanation of the cost calculation,
o (FS Sector) For financial institutions, environmental risks drivers are
mapped to other risk management categories (e.g. credit risk, market
risks, operational risk).
• (Financial Services sector) Financial institutions assess their portfolio for
environmental risks, as well as measure and disclose the current and anticipated
financial effect of the risks.

Requested General
content
• Risks reported should include those which either have had or are anticipated to have a
substantive effect on your strategy, business activities, value chain, financial position (e.g.
assets and liabilities), financial performance (e.g., revenue or expenditure) and cash flows,
irrespective of whether the risk has been responded to or accepted.
• If a risk relates to multiple environmental issues (e.g. climate change and water),
repeat the risk in a row for each relevant environmental issue and use the same risk
identifier (column 2) and provide the same information across these rows.
• Your selection in column 13 “Time horizon over which the risk…” and column 18 “Are you
able to quantify the financial effect of the risk?” will determine the appearance of
subsequent columns:
• If you select “Yes” (i.e. you can provide financial figures related to the risk), columns
19 “Financial effect figure in the reporting year (currency)” to column 25 “Explanation
of financial effect figure” may be presented depending on the time horizons selected
in column 13 “Time horizon over which the risk…”.
Risk identifier (column 2)
• Select a unique identifier from the drop-down list to track the risk across subsequent
questions and reporting years. Select from Risk1-Risk100 and maintain consistency by
using the same identifier for recurring risks. For new risks, use a unique identifier that you
have not previously used.
Page 122 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

• If the risk relates to multiple environmental issues, use the same identifier in each row
referring to the risk.
Risk type and primary risk driver (column 4)
• The risk types are based on the TNFD’s categories of nature-related physical (acute and
chronic) and transition (policy, market, reputation, technology, liability) risks. See the
Explanation of terms for more information on the types of risks.
Value chain stage where the risk occurs (column 5)
• Note for financial services companies: The options shown will be driven by the
organizational activities you selected in 1.10.
• Refer to the “Explanation of Terms” section for definitions of value chain stages.
Risk type mapped to traditional financial services industry risk classification [FS only] (column
6)
• When assessing environmental risks in this column, consider their alignment with your
existing organizational framework. Determine how these risks integrate into your traditional
industry risk framework, particularly regarding the classification of potential financial effect.
If an identified risk corresponds to multiple industry risk categories, select all that apply.
o Capital adequacy and risks weighted assets: refers to the minimum amount
of capital that must be held by financial institutions in order to reduce the risk of
insolvency.
o Liquidity risk: occurs when a financial institution cannot meet its short-term
debt obligations.
o Funding risk: refers to the risk associated with the effect on a project's cash
flow from higher funding costs or lack of availability of funds.
o Market risk: refers to the possibility of loss resulting from an adverse
movement in asset prices.
o Credit risk: refers the possibility of a loss resulting from a counterparty’s failure
to repay a loan or meet contractual obligations.
o Insurance risk: refers to the possibility of loss resulting from an event(s) that
triggers the insurer to pay claims.
o Reputational risk: refers to the risk for negative public perception or to the
potential of uncontrollable events to have an effect on a company's reputation.
o Policy and legal risk: refers to the possibility that legal action will be taken
because of an individual's or corporation's actions, inaction, products, services,
or other events.
o Systemic risk: the possibility that an event at the company level could trigger
severe instability or collapse an entire industry or economy.
o Operational risk: refers to the possibility of loss resulting from failed
processes, systems, human error or outside influences.
Organization-specific description of risk (column 10)
• Provide further contextual information on the risk driver, including more detail on the exact
nature, location and/or regulation of the effect concerned, as well as any notable
geographic/regional examples.
• Include organization-specific details, such as references to activities, programs, products,
services, methodologies, or operating locations specific to your organization’s business or
operations.
% of portfolio value vulnerable to this risk [FS only] (column 12)
• Provide the proportion of your total portfolio value based on total assets value (as reported
in 1.10) that is vulnerable to this risk. See “Explanation of terms” for a definition of
vulnerability.
Magnitude (column 15)
• The magnitude describes the extent to which the effect, if it occurred, would affect your
business. You should consider the business as a whole and therefore the magnitude can
reflect both the damage that may be caused and the exposure to that potential damage.
Page 123 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

• For example, two organizations may have identical facilities located on a coast in an area
which is vulnerable to sea level rise. However, if organization A relies on that facility for
90% of its production capacity and organization B relies on it for only 40% of its production
capacity, the magnitude of a sea level rise effect on organization A will be comparatively
higher than that on company B.
• It is not possible for CDP to accurately define terms for magnitude as they will vary from
organization to organization. For example, a 1% reduction in profits will have different
effects on different organizations depending on the profit margins on which they work.
Therefore, organizations are asked to determine magnitude on a qualitative scale. Factors
to consider include:
o The proportion of business units affected;
o The size of the effect on those business units;
o The dependency of the company on those units; and
o The potential for shareholder or customer concern.
• If the financial effect has not been assessed by your organization, select “Unknown”.
Effect/Anticipated effect of the risk on the financial position, financial performance and cash
flows of the organization in the [reporting year/selected future time horizons] (columns 16 & 17)
• These columns appear dependent on selections in column 13 “Time horizon over which…”.
• If a quantitative figure cannot be provided, explain why the figure cannot be provided and describe
the financial effect in relative terms (e.g., as a percentage relative to a stated or publicly available
figure) or provide a qualitative estimate. Otherwise, if you are unable to provide any information
to quantify the effect, state “The effect has not been quantified financially”.
• Examples of reasons for being unable to provide a quantitative figure include: “the
effects are not separately identifiable” or “the level of measurement uncertainty is too
high, rendering quantitative information about this risk not useful”.
• In the latter case, this column should also be used to provide a description of the
financial effect in relative terms (for example as a percentage relative to a stated or
publicly available figure) or give a qualitative estimate of the financial effect.
Otherwise, if you have no information about the financial effect, please state “The
effect has not been quantified financially”. Quantitative information could include:
• The line items, totals and subtotals within the related financial statements
that are likely to be affected or have been affected by that risk.
Are you able to quantify the financial effects of the opportunity? (column 18)
• It is acknowledged that figures provided will be estimates and, where possible,
assumptions made in arriving at a financial effect figure should be stated in column 26
"Explanation of financial effect figures".
Financial effect/Anticipated financial effect figure […] minimum/maximum (currency) (columns
19-25)
• These columns are only presented if you select “Yes” in column 18 “Are you able to
quantify the financial effect of the risk?”, corresponding to the time horizons selected in
column 13 “Time horizon over which...”.
• Provide the figure for the financial effect in the reporting year, if relevant. Provide the
estimated figure/range for the financial effect per future time horizon, prior to considering
any mitigation measures in place.
• This figure should be in the same currency that you selected in 1.2 for all financial
information disclosed throughout your response.
o Financial figures should reflect the effect of the risk on your organization’s
financial performance, such as revenue and costs and its financial position,
such as assets and liabilities.
o For example, for organizations with a medium-term horizon of 3-5 years, a
cumulative figure/range should be provided for the years covered by the time
horizon.
• For risks which have had an effect in the reporting year (column 19 “Financial effect figure in the
reporting year (currency)”), consider the following when calculating the financial effect of the risk,
alongside any other relevant financial effect of the risk:
Page 124 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

o For physical risks:
▪ The value of capital expenditure on infrastructure asset repair or
replacement as a result of loss and damage,
▪ The percentage increase in insurance costs due to loss and damage,
▪ Capital expenditure on adaption due to the effects of physical risks,
▪ Costs associated with the relocation of operations and suppliers due to
the effects of physical risks.
o For policy risks:
▪ A description and value of any fines/penalties received,
▪ A description and value of clean-up costs,
▪ A description and value of costs relating to loss of operating areas,
▪ A description and value of litigation action taken against the
organization associated with environmental related issues.
o For market risks:
▪ The costs related to loss of market access,
▪ The costs related to raw material and natural resource price volatility.
o For reputational risks:
▪ The increased costs/loss of revenue due to reputational risks,
▪ The decreased revenues due to reduced demand for products and
services and reduced production capacity.
• For technological risks:
▪ Expenditure on R&D for new and alternative technologies related to
mitigation and adaptation of risks.
o For all risks:
▪ Any other effects from environmental risks which have resulted in
increased direct and indirect (operating) costs, increased capital
expenditures, increased credit risk, decreased access to capital and
asset value, decreased asset useful life leading to write-offs, asset
impairment or early retirement of existing assets.
Explanation of financial effect figures (column 26)
• This column is only presented if you select “Yes” in column 18 “Are you able to quantify the financial
effects of the risk?”.
• Explain all financial effect figures across the selected time horizons reported in columns 19-25 and
describe the methodology used to determine these figures (or ranges), including:
o The approach utilized for calculation;
o The calculation method employed;
o How the figure relates to the primary effect identified in column 12 “Primary
financial effect of the risk”;
o The numerical values used in the calculation; and
o Any underlying assumption influencing the figure.
• You can also give further qualitative information, such as describing other financial effects resulting
from the selected risk (aside from the primary effect identified in column 12 “Primary financial effect
of the risk”). If “Other, please specify” is selected in column 12 “Primary financial effect of the risk”,
provide more details on the nature of the effect.
Cost of response to risk (column 28)
• This column only appears if you select any option other than “Plastics” in column 1 “Environmental
issues”.
• Provide a quantitative figure representing the cost of your risk response actions. If there are no
costs associated with responding to the risk, enter 0.
• If an absolute value cannot be provided, report a percentage value by entering 0 in this column and
reporting the percentage figure in column 29 “Explanation of cost calculation”, including an
explanation of the percentage calculation.
• This figure should be in the same currency that you selected in question 1.2 for all financial
information disclosed throughout your response.
Page 125 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

Explanation of cost calculation (column 29)
• This column only appears if you select any option other than “Plastics” in column 1
“Environmental issues”.
• Explain the methodology used to calculate the figure for the cost of managing the risk (in
column 28), including the numerical values used in your calculation.
• If there are no costs associated with responding to the risk, explain how you arrived at a
figure of 0, even if the cost is absorbed into business-as-usual activities.
Description of response (column 30)
• Provide details of your organization’s response to mitigate, control, transfer or accept the
risk, including, if applicable, how the risk has been managed so far and future risk
management procedures.
• Describe the effect the response has had/is likely to have.
• Include an example of organization-specific risk response actions (e.g., activities, projects,
products and/or services).
• Report whether the response strategy involves any collective action initiatives or
contributes to the progress of a UN Sustainable Development Goal.
• Note for water security disclosers: Your public response to this question may be shared
with the Water Action Hub for knowledge sharing and collaboration in water stewardship.
Before submitting your disclosure to CDP, you will be requested to indicate your
permission for CDP to share contact details. This enables the Hub to contact you about a
project suitable for sharing on their platform and obtain your consent. This is optional.
Provide as much relevant information as possible about your response, particularly local
projects, including:
• Partners involved in the joint project/initiative (e.g., organization names or
government offices) or who you would like to work with (e.g., government agencies,
other companies, NGOs);
• Project objectives, including expected benefits for the river basin beyond the
organization.
• Timeline (e.g., start/end date or ongoing project); and
• Specific location, if possible.
Note that these criteria are not scored but are crucial to building a project to share in the
Water Action Hub and without this detail the project may not be suitable to transfer to this
platform.
Requested Note for oil and gas sector organizations:
content – [sector] • Consider the effect of national and international emissions targets on oil and gas
(if applicable) product demand. Will these targets lead to a shift towards a less carbon-intensive fuel
mix? How will fuel efficiency standards influence demand for fuel?
• Identify other regulatory factors affecting demand reduction such as restrictions on
flaring or requirements for a certain level of climate-related performance (e.g.,
requirement for carbon sequestration).
• Include these drivers in your response and explain how your portfolio of reserves is
evolving in response to these regulatory changes.
Note for electric utility sector organizations:
• Electric utilities should consider, among other issues:
• How national and international targets on demand management might affect
electricity demand;
• Implications of related policies such as building regulations promoting energy-
efficient buildings;
• Policies promoting renewable electricity supply and technologies for GHG emissions
reduction, e.g. CO2 capture and storage, clean coal technologies and energy
storage;
The effects of any emissions trading schemes and compliance with emissions reduction
targets, including the analysis of possible scenarios and their effect on your organization;
• Consideration of carbon prices on wholesale and retail power prices across different
markets in which you operate and the extent to which carbon prices may be reflected
Page 126 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

in electricity prices in these markets, based on current and anticipated regulatory
requirements.
Note for auto and auto component manufacturing organizations:
• Consider the financial and strategic implications of current and planned national,
regional, and international policies aimed at increasing automobile fuel efficiency and
developing “clean” engines in each market you operate in.
• Consider the effect of related environmental policies, such as regulations and
standards concerning air quality, alternative fuels usage, and sustainable mobility on
your business.
• Specifically, you should consider how climate change policy may affect your sales,
potential loss of market share, and additional compliance costs. Describe strategies for
managing or passing down increased costs throughout the value chain, if applicable.
Note for agricultural sector organizations:
• Report on risks that may affect the revenue associated with the agriculture/forestry,
processing/manufacturing and/or distribution. These risks often stem from:
o Physical factors, e.g. extreme weather events that disrupt production/supply of
raw materials.
o Changes in regulation pertaining to agricultural, processing, manufacturing,
distribution and/or consumption activities.
o Changes in consumer demands and new market trends.
Note for organizations with coal reserves:
• Refer to CDP Technical Note: Guidance for companies with coal reserves for
comprehensive information on disclosing demand and stranded asset risk.
Note for financial services companies:
• Report risks that are inherent and could have an effect on your investing, financing,
underwriting and/or operational activities, regardless of any prior actions taken to
respond to these risks.
• Financial effect figures should reflect the direct financial effect on your business, such
as the potential write-downs or devaluation of assets, rather than merely portfolio
exposure.
• Describe risks by sector and/or geography, as relevant.
• Consider both physical and transition risks, including the risk of stranded assets. These
are assets that are no longer economically viable as a result of climate-related
transition or physical risks.
• For banks:
o Describe concentrations of credit exposure to carbon-related assets.
o Disclose environmental risks (transition and physical) in lending and other
financial intermediary activities.
• For insurance companies:
o Consider environmental risks on re-/insurance portfolios, including physical,
transition and liability risks;
o Consider potential increases in litigation, such as directors and officers (D&O)
liability claims; and
o Describe environmental risks relevant to your investment portfolio as an asset
owner.
• Asset owners/asset managers:
o Consider environmental risks for each product or investment strategy.
Note for real estate organizations:
• Real estate, being a location-bound and long-term investment, faces significant
exposure to environmental risks.
• Consider "stranding risks" – where assets may be devaluated or underperform, making
them “stranded”.
• Stranded assets may be subject to write-downs due to:
o Demand shifts towards sustainable properties, putting pressure on ‘non-green’
assets; and
o Increased exposure to acute physical risks (e.g., storms, flooding, wildfires).
Page 127 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

Notes for capital goods sector organizations:
• End markets supplied by this sector are subject to increasing regulation and
decarbonization targets; from building standards to mandated technologies for power
generation. Organizations in this sector are thus indirectly exposed to risks in their
value chain, and should consider, among other issues, risks associated with:
o Carbon pricing regulation and stricter emissions constraints on products and
services;
o Shifts in end-market demand away from fossil fuel-dependent technologies.

“Water” row of 3.1.
Change from last year New question
Rationale This question provides investors and data users with more transparency over the
vulnerability of an organization to the substantive effects of environmental risks.
Quantifying vulnerability can provide an understanding of the degree to which the
organization stands to be affected by their anticipated risks. This can inform how and
where the organization responds to environmental risk within their financial planning
and strategy.
Ambition The organization discloses organization-wide information, including:
o Amount and proportion of total annual revenue vulnerable to 1)
physical risks and 2) transition risks,
o Amount and proportion of assets vulnerable to 1) physical risks and 2)
transition risks,
o Amount of capital expenditure deployed towards risks.

Requested General
content
• Options in column 1 “Environmental issue” are dependent on selections in column 1
“Environmental risks identified” of 3.1.
• You should report at least one row for each environmental issue presented in column 1
“Environmental issue”, based on the financial metric in column 2 “Financial metric” most
relevant to your business. You may choose to add rows to report based on additional
financial metrics.
• As per the TCFD and TNFD LEAP guidance, “vulnerability encompasses a variety of
concepts and elements, including sensitivity or susceptibility to harm and lack of capacity
to cope and adapt” (see Explanation of Terms for definition of vulnerability). For
organizations following the LEAP approach, vulnerability is determined in the Assess
phase, considering the likelihood of the risk arising and the organization’s ability to
mitigate the risk.
• Environmental risks to which your organization is vulnerable may relate to one or more
environmental issues. For example, if you have assessed a particular asset to be
vulnerable to climate-change induced flooding risk, you may include the asset in the
calculation of vulnerability to both climate and water-related risks.
Page 129 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

• Consider the amount and proportion of the financial metric vulnerable to risks which are
anticipated to have a substantive effect on the organization in any time horizon. For
example, all assets vulnerable to physical risks in any of the short, medium, or long-term
time horizons should be included when calculating the option selected in column 5
“Amount of financial metric vulnerable to physical risks for this environmental issue (unit
currency as selected in 1.2)”.
Financial metric (column 2)
• Select the financial metric for which you have assessed your organization’s vulnerability to
risks related to the environmental issue in column 1.
• If reporting multiple financial metrics to indicate your organization’s vulnerability to risks for
each environmental issue, you may add rows to report additional financial metrics.
• You should report the metrics that are most relevant to your business activities.
% of total financial metric vulnerable to physical/transition risks for this environmental issue
(column 4 & 6)
• Out of the total of the financial metric selected in column 2 “Financial metric”, indicate the
proportion of that metric considered vulnerable to risks relating to this environmental issue.
• Calculate this number by dividing the value provided in column 3 “Amount of financial
metric vulnerable to transition risks for this environmental issue (unit currency as selected
in 1.2)” by the total value of the selected financial metric.
o E.g. If “Climate change” is the environmental issue in column 1 “Environmental
issue” and "Revenue" is the financial metric selected in column 2 “Financial
metric”, divide the value of your revenue vulnerable to climate-related risks by
your total revenue.
• Select the closest range to the calculated % and provide an explanation in column 8
“Explanation of financial figures”.
Amount of CAPEX in the reporting year deployed towards risks related to this environmental
issue (column 7)
• This column only appears if you select “CAPEX” in column 2 “Financial metric”.
• Indicate the total amount of capital expenditure in the reporting year that was spent
towards risks relating to each environmental issue.
o E.g. If you purchased a particular asset in the reporting year as a response to a
climate-related risk, the capital expenditure associated with this purchase
should be included in the figure reported in row “Climate change”.
Explanation of financial figures (column 8)
• There are differing approaches to the calculation of vulnerability to risk. Describe the
methodology used to derive the figures, including:
o The approach employed for calculation; and
o Any assumptions underlying the figure.

Rationale Information on river basins provides a deeper understanding of the potential significance of
the water risk exposure associated with each basin, which may be driven by the
organization’s dependencies and impacts.
Knowing the number of facilities at risk for each basin and the potential impact of this risk
exposure helps organizations with decision making based on basin-level issues. It allows
financial planning at that level to take account of water issues and provides a powerful
indicator to support river basin action and investment.

sector-specific guidance provided at the end of the “Requested content” section.
content
General
• Consider water-related risks that could have substantive effects on your organization
at the corporate level. Do not include local risks unless they are substantive for the
organization as a whole. For example, out of 10 facilities in a river basin exposed to
water-related risk, only 3 might have substantive effect on the organization at the
corporate level should they materialize. Therefore, only those three facilities should
be reported.
• The environmental risks reported should be those which have had or are anticipated
to have a substantive effect when considering the inherent risk (existing in the
absence of controls, i.e. not considering any mitigation or management measures that
have been or could be implemented) as well as the residual risk (remaining after a
specific action has been taken to manage the risk).
• If facilities are exposed to water-related risks in a basin covering multiple
countries/areas, add a new row for each country/area and disclose the number of
facilities located there.
• Oil & gas sector only: Provide data on the organization’s production volume
associated with these facilities.
• Electric utilities sector only: Provide data on the organization’s annual electricity
generation associated with these facilities.
River basin (column 1b)
• Select the relevant river basin from the drop-down options or select “Other, please
specify” if applicable.
• For organizations withdrawing water from large confined aquifers that may not
discharge to the selected river basin, select “Other, please specify” and specify the
local aquifer source.
• You may provide the sub-basin details using the “Other, please specify” option in the
following format: “Putumayo, Amazon”.
• For full instructions regarding this list, see CDP’s Full Corporate Questionnaire:
Overview.
Number of facilities within direct operations exposed to water-related risk in this river basin
(column 3)
• This column only appears if you select “Direct Operations” in column 2 “Value chain
stages where facilities at risk have been identified in this river basin”.
• Report the number of facilities within your direct operations exposed to water-related
risk in the selected river basin.
• The term ‘facilities’ may be used broadly to describe different types of business
operations as well as fixed buildings or factories.
% of your organization’s total facilities within direct operations exposed to water-related risk in this
river basin (column 4)
• Indicate the proportion of facilities out of your organization’s total number of facilities
within direct operations that are exposed to water-related risk in the specified river
basin. For example, if you have a total of 100 facilities within direct operations globally
and 11 of these facilities are reported in column 3 “Number of facilities within direct
operations exposed to water-related risk in this basin”, then the percentage
represented by these facilities is 11% and you should select the “1-25%” option in
this column.
• If you cannot calculate this figure, you may provide an estimate. If providing an
estimate is not possible, select “Unknown” and explain your response in column 11
“Please explain”.
Electric utilities sector only: % organization's annual electricity generation that could be affected
by these facilities (column 7)
• This column only appears if you select “Electricity generation” in column 1b “Aspect”
in 1.16.
Page 133 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

• Select "Not applicable", only if no facilities in the river basin generate electricity and
elaborate in column 11 “Please explain”.
Oil and gas sector only: % organization's global oil & gas production volume that could be affected
by these facilities (column 9)
• Select "Not applicable", only if no facilities in the basin are associated with your oil &
gas sector activities and elaborate in column 11 “Please explain”.
% organization’s total global revenue that could be affected (column 10)
• Indicate the percentage of your organization’s total global revenue derived from the
facilities listed in column 3 “Number of facilities within direct operations exposed to
water-related risk in this river basin”, reflecting potential risk exposure.
o For example, if column 3 “Number of facilities within direct operations
exposed to water-related risk in this river basin” indicates that 11 facilities are
exposed to water-related risk, they may contribute to 16-30% of your
organization’s total global revenue.
• This revenue may be at risk to some extent in the absence of an appropriate
response strategy (e.g., operational disruptions).
• If you cannot calculate this figure, you may provide an estimate. If providing an
estimate is not possible, select “Unknown”and explain your response in column 11
“Please explain”.
Please explain (column 11)
• Provide additional context on your basin-level disclosure, detailing how your
organization's dependencies and impacts in the river basin relate to identified water-
related risks. You may also wish to comment on the nature or severity of the risk in
the river basin as a whole that these facilities are exposed to and the organization’s
approach to addressing these risks.
• Provide any further details on the potential value at risk in these river basins,
including any estimates or assumptions made.
Requested Sector-specific guidance for metals and mining and coal sectors
content – General
[sector] • This guidance is supplementary to the general instructions and applies specifically to
(if applicable) organizations in the metals and mining and/or coal sectors.
• Data on the production value associated with these facilities will enhance
understanding of water risk implications and aid assessment of the organization’s
response.
Production value for the metals and mining activities associated with these facilities (currency)
(column 8)
• Consider the production value potentially exposed to inherent water-related risks in
the selected river basin in column 1b (e.g., in the absence of an appropriate response
strategy and/or operational disruptions)
• Provide a financial figure associated with the facilities at risk reported. This figure
should be aligned with the chosen currency disclosed in 1.2.
• If the facility does not belong to the metals and mining and/or coal sectors, report “0”
and explain this in column 11 (Please explain).
• If the facility is not operational, report '0', or provide the expected annual production
value and explain your choice in column 11 “Please explain”.
• In column 11, elaborate on your approach.
• If you cannot provide this figure, leave this field blank and explain your reasons in
column 11 “Please explain”.
Please explain (column 11)
• Clarify the approach to reporting production value, offering insights or clarifications for
data users.

General
• CDP does not provide guidance as to what constitutes a “significant” regulatory violation,
as this will vary by local context and the nature of the business. However, it will usually
imply a major impact on the environment, community and/or business(es).
• Organizations should develop a consistent use of the term throughout their response. If
you need further guidance as to what constitutes “significant”, CDP recommends
companies consider the general definition of “materiality” provided in the GRI Standards
as a starting point. This definition puts the onus on companies to determine a materiality
threshold based on internal, industry, and external stakeholder interests.
Note: this question asks about fines, enforcement orders and/or penalties that your company
was issued with during the reporting year. You should not include information about fines and
penalties that were issued to your company in a previous but became payable in this year.
Type of penalty (column 1)
• If you select “Other, please specify”, provide a label for the type of penalty.
Financial impact (column 2)
• Your response should include all costs related to the regulatory violation, i.e. financial
penalties imposed on your organization, costs related to an enforcement order or any
other operational or capital expenditure resulting directly to the violation itself or actions
to prevent its reoccurrence, such as having to install new technology to meet the
requirements of an enforcement order or employing new staff to monitor for compliance
etc.
• This figure should be in the same currency that you selected for all financial information
disclosed throughout your response in question W0.4.
Country/Area (column 3a)
• Note that this is asking for the location of the incident associated with the penalty
selected in column 1.
• If more than one country/area applies, please select a primary country/area and explain
this in column 5.
• Note that a selection must be made for both column 3a and column 3b. Your data will
not be saved if either column is left blank.
Page 139 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

River basin (column 3b)
• Note that this is asking for the river basin associated with the incident that led to the
penalty reported in column 1.
• From the drop-down options provided, select the appropriate river basin. If you do not
see the basin required, select “Other, please specify” and write in the correct river basin
using the text box provided.
• For companies withdrawing water from large confined aquifers that may not discharge to
the river basin they are located in e.g. Ogallala aquifer in the United States, please
select “Other, please specify” and type in the name of the local aquifer source. Ensure
that the correct country/area name is selected in column 3a (Country/Area).
• You may want to put the sub-basin of a bigger river basin identified in the drop-down
menu. In this case use the “Other, please specify” option in the following format:
“Putumayo, Amazon”.
• If you select “Other, please specify”, provide a label for the river basin.
• For full instructions see the Introduction to CDP's water security reporting guidance.
• Note that a selection must be made for both column 3a and column 3b. Your data will
not be saved if either column is left blank.

• Select the type of incident that is most applicable to the penalty selected in column 1.
• If you select “Other, please specify”, provide a label for the type of incident.
Description of penalty, incident, regulatory violation, significance, and resolution (column 5)
• Penalty: Your response here could include any details that would help CDP data users
understand the fine, enforcement order or other penalty selected in column 1.
• Significance: You may include a description of how and why your organization is
classifying the penalty in column 1 as significant for your organization.
• Incident and regulatory violation: For each penalty you list in column 1, you may give
details of the incident and regulatory violation that resulted in the penalty, e.g.:
• more details on the incident/violation selected in column 4; e.g. the nature of a breach in
an abstraction license or a discharge consent, or the nature of other water and
wastewater related regulation violation.
• whether the penalty was for a single incident or multiple incidents, and the frequency
with which it/they occurred.
• the impact the incident and the penalty had on your business, other water users and/or
the natural environment; whether there were any criminal sanctions.
• Resolution: Please provide a brief description of how your organization has resolved or
is planning to resolve the incident, including steps taken to ensure the regulatory
violation is not repeated. This may include, for example, internal actions and/or external
engagement such as: upgrading facilities, changing treatment methods, decreasing
volume of discharge, increasing volumes of reused or recycled water, engaging with
policymakers, or engaging with local communities. If your organization has a
compliance assurance system in place, you may provide details.

Environmental Issue Question level Biodiversity only
(Theme)
Question level M-B
Sector
(3.5) Are any of your operations or activities regulated by a carbon pricing system (i.e. ETS, Cap &
Trade or Carbon Tax)?
Question details
Change from last No change (2023 C11.1)
year
Rationale Companies are requested to report whether they are subject to, or potentially subject to,
mandatory carbon pricing systems. This question has evolved to include whether companies
are currently regulated by a carbon pricing system – including carbon markets or taxation – or
whether they expect to be regulated in the future. Companies responding ”Yes” will be further
prompted to identify the systems in which they participate and to provide additional details about
their exposure to these systems. This information allows investors to consistently track and
analyze corporate expectations and the associated costs of carbon pricing regulations, and
forces unregulated companies to consider potential future exposure.
Response options Select one of the following options:
• Yes
• No, but we anticipate being regulated in the next three years
• No, and we do not anticipate being regulated in the next three years
Requested content General
• Companies responding “Yes” will be further prompted to identify the systems in which
they participate and to provide additional details about their exposure to these
systems.
Additional Carbon pricing policies: Carbon pricing is a key policy mechanism to drive greenhouse gas
information emissions reductions and mitigate the dangerous impacts of climate change. Policies primarily
manifest in one of two ways; or, in some countries, areas and regions, both ways:
• An emissions trading scheme, also known as a cap and trade system, is a market-
based allowance system in which participants can buy and sell a set amount of
allowances based on their emissions levels. Low emitters will have allowances left over
for sale, which higher emitters will buy to offset their emissions – operating in a
demand and supply scenario.
Page 144 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

• A carbon tax which attaches a fee to carbon emissions.
These policies in practice vary specifically on a case-by-case basis.

Requested General
content • Although some emission trading schemes may apply solely to the operators of facilities,
the financial position of facility owners is also affected indirectly by the operation of the
scheme. This question therefore applies to both owners and operators of facilities covered
by trading schemes.
• Regardless of full facility ownership, report total number of emissions and allowances.
System name (column 0)
• This column is driven by the emission trading schemes selected in 3.5.1. Enter information
for all relevant emission trading schemes.
% of Scope 1 emissions covered by the ETS (column 1)
• Calculate this percentage based on your gross global Scope 1 emissions over the
monitoring period of the emissions trading scheme as specified in columns 3.
% of Scope 2 emissions covered by the ETS (column 2)
• Calculate this percentage based on your gross global Scope 2 emissions over the
monitoring period of the emissions trading scheme as specified in columns 3 and 4.
• Note that in this question you should only report Scope 2 emissions subject to direct
regulation, meaning those for which you receive allowances directly within an emissions
trading scheme. Enter “0” if you have no direct compliance obligations for Scope 2
emissions.
Period start date and end date (columns 3 and 4)
• The period start date and end date refer to the annual compliance cycle of the emission
trading schemes, not the overall phase of the scheme. For example, in the current
European Union ETS third phase (2013 to 2020), the monitoring period of the annual
compliance cycle ran from 1st January to 31st December.
• While emissions trading systems verification deadlines may not always align with the
reporting year disclosed in 1.4 it is important to ensure that the period start date and end
dates reported overlap with the reporting year.

Response options This is an open text question with a limit of 5,000 characters.
Requested content General
• Some of the options for compliance include emissions reductions strategies, efficiency
upgrades, purchase of allowances and the purchase of carbon credits.
• Depending on how long your company has been regulated by a carbon pricing system,
efficiency upgrades may not provide the amount of reductions necessary to comply with
regulations. If that is the case for your company, then you are also encouraged to detail
your company’s long-term compliance and regulatory risk management strategy;
including the specific metric(s) or mechanism(s) used – for example, a dedicated carbon
risk management team or the use of an internal carbon price. If you use an internal
carbon price, please make note of this here and provide specific details the subsequent

Page 151 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

Rationale It is crucial for investors and data users to know whether your organization has identified any
environmental opportunities within your direct operations or across your value chain with the
potential to have substantive effects on your organization. This includes both opportunities
which have already had an effect in the reporting year, as well as opportunities which may
have an effect in the future. If no environmental opportunities with substantive effects have
been identified as part of your assessment, it is equally crucial for data users to understand
how and why your organization has concluded that you are not presented with any
opportunities.
Ambition The organization discloses environmental opportunities which have had or are anticipated to
have a substantive effect on its business activities, value chain, financial position (e.g., assets
and liabilities), financial performance (e.g., revenue or expenditure) and cash flows.

opportunity,
o Whether the opportunities are related to resource efficiency, energy source,
capital flow and financing, products and services, markets, reputational capital
and/or resilience,
o How the organization is responding to opportunities, including changes made
to pursue them, relevant time periods, and how opportunities are prioritized,
• (Financial Services sector) Financial institutions assess their portfolios for
environmental opportunities, and measure and disclose the potential financial effect of
the opportunities.

Requested content General
• Opportunities reported should include those which either have had or are anticipated to
have substantive effect on your strategy, business activities, value chain, financial
position (e.g. assets and liabilities), financial performance (e.g., revenue or expenditure)
and cash flows.
• If an opportunity relates to multiple environmental issues (e.g. climate change and water),
repeat the opportunity in a row for each relevant environmental issue and use the same
opportunity identifier (column 2) and provide the same information across these rows.
• Your selection in column 11 “Time horizon over which the opportunity…” and column 16
“Are you able to quantify the financial effect of the opportunity?” will determine the
appearance of subsequent columns:
If you select “Yes” (i.e. you can provide financial figures related to the opportunity),
columns 17 “Financial effect figure in the reporting year (currency)” to column
24 “Explanation of financial effect figure” may be presented depending on the
time horizons selected in column 11 “Time horizon over which the opportunity
…”.
Opportunity identifier (column 2)
• Select a unique identifier to identify the opportunity in subsequent questions, if required,
and to track the status of the opportunity in subsequent reporting years. Use the same
identifier in subsequent years for the same opportunity. For any new opportunities you
are adding, always use a new identifier that you have not used previously.
• If the opportunity relates to multiple environmental issues, use the same identifier in each
row referring to the opportunity. E.g. Use Forest and Climate change rows to report a
sustainability linked loan that references low-emissions and deforestation/conversion free
product targets.
Opportunity type and primary environmental opportunity driver (column 4)
• Select an option from the drop-down menu that best describes the type of the identified
opportunity:
o Resource efficiency – opportunities related to improving resource efficiency
across production and distribution processes, buildings,
machinery/appliances, and transport/mobility.
o Energy source - opportunities related to shifting energy usage toward low
emission energy sources.
Resilience – opportunities related to the development of adaptive capacity to
respond to and develop with change and uncertainty [adapted from TNFD,
2023]. They may be especially relevant for organizations with long-lived fixed
assets or extensive supply or distribution networks; those that depend critically
on utility and infrastructure networks or natural resources in their value chain;
and those that may require longer-term financing and investment.].TNFD,
2023]. They may be especially relevant for organizations with long-lived fixed
assets or extensive supply or distribution networks; those that depend critically
on utility and infrastructure networks or natural resources in their value chain;
and those that may require longer-term financing and investment.]. They may
be especially relevant for organizations with long-lived fixed assets or
Page 158 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

extensive supply or distribution networks; those that depend critically on utility
and infrastructure networks or natural resources in their value chain; and
those that may require longer-term financing and investment.
o Markets – opportunities in new markets or types of assets that may help
organizations to diversify their activities and better position themselves for the
transition to a lower-carbon and nature positive economy including consumer
demands consumer and investor sentiment and stakeholder dynamics
[adapted from TNFD].
o Products and services - opportunities related to innovation and development
of new products and services that protect, manage or restore nature [adapted
from TNFD]
o Reputational capital - Changes in perception concerning a company’s actual
or perceived nature impacts, including the consequent impacts on society and
engagement of stakeholders [TNFD, 2023].
o Capital flow and financing - Access to capital markets, improved financing
terms or financial products connected to the management of nature-related
dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities [TNFD, 2023].].
Value chain stage where the opportunity occurs (column 5)
• Note for financial services companies: The options shown will be driven by the
organizational activities you selected in 1.10.
• Refer to the “Explanation of Terms” section for definitions of value chain stages.
Organization-specific description (column 9)
• Provide further context on the opportunity driver, including more detail on the exact
nature, location, and/or regulation of the effect concerned, as well as any notable
geographic/regional examples.
• Include information on how the opportunity links to any of the organization’s risks, as
reported in 3.1.1.
• Include organization-specific detail, such as references to activities, programs, products,
services, methodologies, or operating locations specific to your organization’s business or
operations.
Primary financial effect of the opportunity (current or anticipated) (column 10)
• This column refers to the potential financial effect that the opportunity could have on
your organization. The financial effects of environmental opportunities on
organizations are not always clear or direct, and for many organizations there might be
more than one financial effect associated with an environmental opportunity.
• Select the option that you deem to have the biggest effect. You can provide additional
details on other financial effects in column 24 “Explanation of financial effect figures”.
Magnitude (column 13)
• The magnitude describes the extent to which the effect, if it occurred, would affect your
business. This should consider the business as a whole and therefore the magnitude
can reflect both the opportunity and the extent to which it applies throughout the
organization.
• An assessment of the ‘magnitude’ of the potential financial benefit arising from an
absolute value will vary in scale and metric from organization to organization so it is
not possible for CDP to accurately define the terms for magnitude. For example, two
organizations may report a potential financial effect figure of $500,000. For
organization A this could represent a 1% increase in profits, but a 15% increase in
revenue for organization B. Therefore, organizations are asked to determine
magnitude on a qualitative 5-point scale from High to Low.
• Factors to consider include:
o The proportion of business units affected;
o The size of the effect on those business units; and
o The potential for shareholder or customer response.
• If the financial effect has not been assessed by your organization, select “Unknown”.
Page 159 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

Effect / Anticipated effect of the opportunity on the financial position, financial performance and
cash flows of the organization [in the reporting year / in the selected time horizons] (column 14
& 15)
• These columns appear dependent on selections in column 11 “Time horizon over
which…”.
• Provide details on the effects of the opportunity on financial position (e.g. assets and
liabilities), financial performance (e.g., revenue or expenditure) and cash flows of your
organization:
o Examples of reasons why no quantitative figure can be included are: “the
effects are not separately identifiable” or “the level of measurement
uncertainty is too high such that quantitative information about this opportunity
would not be useful”.
o In the latter case, this column should also be used to provide a description of
the financial effect in relative terms (for example as a percentage relative to a
stated or publicly available figure) or give a qualitative estimate of the financial
effect. Otherwise, if you have no information about the financial effect, please
state “The effect has not been quantified financially”. Quantitative information
could include:
▪ The line items, totals and subtotals within the related financial
statements that are likely to be affected or have been affected by that
opportunity.
Are you able to quantify the financial effects of the opportunity? (column 16)
• It is acknowledged that figures provided will be estimates and, where possible,
assumptions made in arriving at a financial effect figure should be stated in column 24
"Explanation of financial effect figures".
Financial effect/Anticipated financial effect figure […] minimum/maximum (currency) (columns
17-23)
• Your selection in column 11 “Time horizon over which...” drives the appearance of
column 17 “Financial effect figure in the reporting year (currency)” to column 23
“Anticipated financial effect figure in the long-term – maximum (currency)”.
• Provide the figure for the financial effect in the reporting year, if relevant. Provide the
estimated figure/range for the financial effect of the opportunity per future time horizon.
• This figure should be in the same currency that you selected in question 1.2 for all
financial information disclosed throughout your response.
o Financial effect figure – minimum (currency): use this field to report the
lower point of your estimated financial effect associated with the
opportunity. For example, if the range is from US $5,000 to $50,000,
"5,000" should be reported here.
o Financial effect figure – maximum (currency): use this field to report the
upper point of your estimated financial effect associated with the
opportunity. For example, if the range is from US $5,000 to $50,000,
"50,000" should be reported here.
• Provide a cumulative figure/range for the years covered by the time horizon in the
respective columns. For example, if an organization’s medium-term is 3-5 years, then
figures for the sum of these three years should be provided in the respective columns.
• When providing a single financial figure, companies should respond to both the
“minimum” and “maximum” columns with the same figure.
Explanation of financial effect figures (column 24)
• This column is only presented if you select “Yes” in column 16 “Are you able to quantify the
financial effects of the opportunity?”.
• Describe how you arrived at this figure (or range) for each of your selected time
horizons, including:
o What approach was employed to calculate the figure;
o The calculation method;
o The figures used in your calculations; and
o Any assumptions the figure is dependent on.
• You can also describe here other financial effects of the selected opportunity (other
than the main effect identified in column 9 “Organization-specific description”, and
Page 160 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

provide more details on the nature of the effect in case you selected “Other, please
specify” in column 9 “Organization-specific description”.
Cost to realize opportunity (column 25)
• Provide numerical data on the cost to realize opportunity. If there are no costs to this,
enter 0.
• If you cannot provide an absolute value, you may report a percentage value by
entering 0 in this column and then reporting the percentage figure in column 26
“Explanation of cost calculation”, including an explanation for how the percentage was
calculated.
Explanation of cost calculation (column 26)
• Provide an explanation of how the figure for the cost of realizing the opportunity was
calculated, including the figures used in your calculation.
• If there are no costs to realize the opportunity, you should still explain how you arrived
at a figure of 0, even if the cost is absorbed into business-as-usual activities.
Strategy to realize opportunity (column 27)
• Use this text field to provide information on methods you are using or plan to use to
exploit the opportunity and maximize its potential realization. Make sure to include:
o An example of organization-specific activities, projects, products and/or
services which are aiming to realize the opportunity; and
o An explanation of how this opportunity has been prioritized in relation to other
opportunities.
Requested content – Note for electric utility sector organizations:
[sector] only (if • Consider:
applicable) o Opportunities that may arise from emissions trading;
o The opportunities that national or international targets on energy efficiency
and demand management might present for your organization e.g. revenue
implications from energy services business units;
o Your organization’s views on any opportunities that may result from policies on
renewable energy or low emissions technologies e.g. current or planned
investments in these areas; and
o The extent to which you receive financial incentives to reduce the electricity
use of customers.
Note for agricultural sector organizations:
• Agricultural organizations should report on opportunities that the revenue associated
with the agricultural/forestry, processing/manufacturing and/or distribution of raw
materials and goods. For example, opportunities might arise from:
o Increased efficient by reducing energy use during the production of raw
materials and/or the manufacture of food, beverage and other goods;
o Reduced costs due to carbon payments by adopting practices or technology to
reduce carbon footprint;
o Government of private financial incentives for adoption low impact
agriculture/forestry.
Note for financial services companies:
• Consider opportunities associated with financial products and services such as green
and blue bonds, sustainable infrastructure, sustainable loans/mortgages, sustainable
insurance products, financial products and services ensuring resiliency, specialty
environmental risk advisory services and others, or opportunities your clients/investees
are exploiting that have a positive effect on your portfolio (e.g. clients reducing costs
through water efficiency resulting in less credit risk)
• Note that if providing a financial effect figure, this figure should represent the financial
effect on your business. For example, the potential interest income generated by
green loans should be reported, as opposed to the potential size of the green loan
book.
Page 161 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

• You should consider providing a description of your opportunities by sector and/or
geography, as appropriate.
Note for capital goods sector organizations:
• In line with the TCFD’s recommendations, organizations in this sector should consider
opportunities for products or services that improve efficiency, reduce energy use and
support closed-loop product solutions.

Requested General
content • If your organization has an equivalent governing body, respond based on the equivalent
governing body.
• If your organization has two-tier board system, respond with respect to your board structure
as a whole.
• Note that this question asks about the positions and not about the names of the staff holding
these positions. Do not include the name of any individual or any other personal data in your
response.
Positions of individuals or committees with accountability for this environmental issue (column 1)
• Select the position of the individual on the board who is accountable for the environmental
issue in column 0 “Environmental issue”. This may be an individual member of the board or a
board level committee (e.g., sustainability committee, risk committee etc.).
• If accountability falls jointly to more than one position, select multiple positions.
• If accountability falls jointly to the members of a committee, rather than an individual position,
select “Board-level committee.”
• If the position is not listed here, select the closest match for your organization, or select
“Other, please specify”.
• See the “Explanation of terms” for a definition of board accountability. In practical terms, this
is the person or committee at the top of the chain of command specifically managing
information on the environmental issue in column 0 “Environmental issue”, making decisions
about what the organization will do and adapting those decisions based on information
relating to the environmental issue.
• The CEO is ultimately accountable for everything in the organization; however, this question
is looking to identify board-level accountability specifically with respect to your organization’s
environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities. While this may be the CEO, it
is not necessarily always the case.
Positions’ accountability for this environmental issue is outlined in policies applicable to the board
(column 2)
• A position’s accountability for environmental issues can be defined in various policies,
charters, directives and/or other formal documents applicable to the board, such the board’s
terms of reference, the board mandate, or in role descriptions for specific individuals that sit
on the board.
• These formal documents may set out the details of the position’s accountability for
environmental issues and detail expectations of the board and its committees regarding
environmental issues.
Policies which outline the positions’ accountability for this environmental issue (column 3)
Page 171 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

• This column only appears if “Yes” is selected in column 2 “Positions’ accountability for this
environmental issue is outlined in policies applicable to the board”.
Frequency with which this environmental issue is a scheduled agenda item (column 4)
• You should consider the frequency that the environmental issue in column 0 “Environmental
issue” is a scheduled agenda item for the principal board-level committee that has oversight
and accountability for environmental issues. This may be a subcommittee of the board, or the
full board itself.
• If the frequency is not listed here, select the closest match for your organization.
Governance mechanisms into which this environmental issue is integrated (column 5)
• Select all the governance mechanisms into which the environmental issue in column 0
“Environmental issue” is integrated as part of the board’s oversight.
• Note that your response to this column should not be limited to only the governance
mechanisms for which the positions selected in column 1 “Positions of individuals or
committees with accountability for this environmental issue”, have direct responsibility – you
should consider your organization’s governance mechanisms as a whole and how the
environmental issue in column 0 “Environmental issue” is integrated. For example, if your
Chief Sustainability Officer has ultimate accountability for water-related issues as indicated in
column 1 “Positions of individuals or committees with accountability for this environmental
issue”, the responsibility for integrating water-related issues into “reviewing and guiding
annual budgets” may fall under the remit of the Chief Financial Officer. In this case,
“reviewing and guiding annual budgets” should still be selected as water-related issues are
integrated, even though direct responsibility does not fall with the position ultimately
accountable for all water-related issues.
Scope of board-level oversight (column 6)
• Activities of a business may both be affected by environmental issues and impact the
environment. For financial institutions, these effects may materialize via the organization’s
own operations, the financial products and services offered to its clients, and/or its
investments. This column seeks insight on whether an organization’s board considers:
• how the risks posed, or opportunities presented by
environmental issues affect its business; and conversely
• how its business activities impact the environment, either
positively or negatively.
Please explain (column 7)
• Describe the governance mechanisms selected in column 5 “Governance mechanisms into
which this environmental issue is integrated” and explain how these mechanisms contribute
to the board's overall oversight of the environmental issue in column 0 “Environmental
issue”. For example, if in the row “Climate change” you selected in column 5 “Overseeing the
setting of corporate targets” and “Monitoring progress towards corporate targets”, describe
the process for how the board oversees and monitors your organization’s climate-related
targets and progress towards those targets.
• Include details such as examples of specific board agenda items related to the environmental
issue (e.g. Water, Sanitation and Hygiene, or emissions reporting obligations), information on
who briefs the board and on which matters (e.g., "a report from each Business Head
regarding progress towards climate-related targets is reviewed quarterly by the board"), and
details of the process of integrating the environmental issue into your organization’s
governance mechanisms.
• Provide examples of decisions the positions/committees selected in column 1 “Position of
individual or committee with accountability for this environmental issue” have made or
contributed to with respect to the board’s oversight of the environmental issue in column 0
“Environmental issue” via the governance mechanisms selected in column 5 “Governance
mechanisms into which this environmental issue is integrated”. As much as possible, give
examples from the reporting year.
Page 172 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

• Indicate whether and how the board considers trade-offs associated with risks and
opportunities related to the environmental issue (e.g., a trade-off between higher costs of
switching to a new technology and increased consumer preferences for eco-friendly
technologies).

year
Rationale Employee incentives linked to sustainability performance send a clear signal about the role that
employees are expected to play in achieving the organization’s environmental commitments
and targets. Data users aim to understand the degree to which organizations encourage their
employees to address environmental issues, as well as the mechanisms by which certain
behaviors are incentivized in the organization’s decision making and business culture.
Ambition
• The organization includes environmental performance metrics in their monetary incentives
policies for at least board and senior management levels.
• The organization ties a significant proportion of total remuneration to environmental
performance, and more specifically to the achievement of environmental targets. This
proportion is significant at board and senior management levels.

content • Note that incentives can be positive, e.g., providing rewards for demonstrating desired
behaviors, or they can be negative, e.g., issuing penalties or withholding rewards for not
meeting certain standards.
• Note that only monetary incentives should be reported in this question. When assessing
whether your organization provides monetary incentives, include all incentives that could
have a monetary value equivalent, such as share-based compensation. See Explanation of
Terms.
% of total C-suite and board-level monetary incentives linked to the management of this
environmental issue (column 2)
• This column is only presented if “Yes” is selected in column 1 “Provision of monetary
incentives related to this environmental issue”.
• Enter the percentage of the total amount of C-suite and board-level monetary incentivization
provided for the management of each environmental issue in relation to the total amount of
all C-suite and board-level monetary incentives provided in the reporting year.
• If you do not provide monetary incentives for the management of environmental issues for
any C-suite or board-level positions, enter 0 in this column. For example, if you do not
provide any climate-related incentives, enter 0 in row “Climate change”.
• You should only provide a figure for the rows for which outcomes relating to the
environmental issue are specified. For example, if you provide an environmental, social, and
corporate governance (ESG) incentive that is solely tied to forests and water security
outcomes, without incentivizing specific climate change-related outcomes, the same figure
should be reported for “Forests” and “Water”, while “Climate change” should be reported as
0.
• If your organization has incentives linked to environment, health and safety (EHS), report
only the proportion relating to environmental performance metrics.
Please explain (column 3)
• If you selected “Yes” in any row in column 1 “Provision of monetary incentives related to this
environmental issue”, explain the extent to which your monetary incentives related to
environmental issues form a part of your total monetary incentivization package for
employees.
• If you selected any “No” option in any row in column 1, explain why you do not provide
monetary incentives related to the environmental issue.
• Explain each figure provided in column 2. For example, if your organization provides
monetary incentives related to climate-change outcomes only at board-level, explain why
here.

Requested General
content
• If there is more than one senior position entitled to incentives related to the environmental
issue, provide details on the highest senior position entitled to incentives. If you would like
to describe more than one senior position entitled to incentives, you may use the "Add
Row” button. This is optional. In this case, ensure that the position with the highest level of
responsibility is in the top row of the table.
• Note that this question asks about the position of employees entitled to incentives.
Do not include the name of any individual or any other personal data in your
response.
Position entitled to monetary incentive (column 2)
• Select the position of the individual who is entitled to the incentive. If the position is not
listed here, select the closest match for your organization or select “Other, please specify”.
Incentives (column 3)
• Select all relevant incentives from the drop-down list, or select “Other, please specify”.
• Note that only monetary incentives should be reported in this question.
Performance metrics (column 4)
• Select the performance metrics relevant to the monetary incentives for the position
selected in column 2 “Position entitled to monetary incentive”. You will have the
opportunity to provide further details in column 6 “Further details of incentives”.
Incentive plan the incentives are linked to (column 5)
• Indicate whether the climate-related incentive(s) for this position is part of an incentive
plan:
• Short-Term Incentive Plans (STIPs) aim to reward employees for their individual
contribution to achieving short-term business objectives and maximizing organizational
performance over the course of a year. For example, if the position was contractually
eligible to receive a bonus based on annual performance against environmental
performance metrics in the reporting year, select the appropriate “Short-Term Incentive
Plan” option in this column.
• Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) aim to reward and retain employees who are key to
achieving the organization’s long-term strategic goals. Incentives that are part of an
employee’s LTIP are usually rewarded over the course of/after a number of years. For
example, if the position was contractually eligible to receive a bonus based on performance
against environmental performance metrics over a multi-year period including the reporting
year, select the appropriate “Long-Term Incentive Plan” option in this column.
• Incentives may be awarded on a discretionary basis. If, for example, the position does not
have an incentive plan, but was eligible for a discretionary bonus in the reporting year,
Page 188 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

select “The incentives are not linked to an incentive plan, or equivalent (e.g. discretionary
bonus in the reporting year)”.
Further details of incentives (column 6)
• Use this field to provide further details of the monetary incentives the position is entitled to,
including:
o The time period over which performance against each of the metrics selected in
column 4 “Performance metrics” is measured.
o Quantitative details of the incentives and the performance metrics.
o Regional, sectoral, and/or operational context.
How the position’s incentives contribute to the achievement of your environmental
commitments and/or climate transition plan (column 7)
• Explain if your incentives have already contributed to the implementation or achievement of
your organization’s environmental commitments and/or transition plan and what actions
have been taken due to the incentives being in place. For example:
o How the performance metrics reported in column 4 “Performance metrics” are
linked to key performance indicators (KPIs) within your climate transition plan, or
o How they will progress your environmental commitments, e.g., to reach net-zero
emissions by 2050, control/reduce/eliminate water pollution or eliminate
deforestation and conversion of other natural ecosystems.
• Note that you will be asked to provide details on your organization’s environmental
commitments in 4.6 and on your organization’s climate transition plan in 5.2.

Rationale An environmental policy is a key governance tool which serves as a foundation to drive action
while ensuring accountability. Setting a corporate environmental policy for environmental
issues indicates that the organization understands their importance and recognizes its
responsibility in taking environmental action.
Therefore, data users wish to know that organizations have articulated and documented a
policy that acknowledges the organization’s dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities
associated with environmental issues, and have clear intentions and direction for action. For
accountability to the organization’s stakeholders, the policy should be publicly available.
Ambition
• The organization has publicly available policies which address environmental
dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities related to the organization and its value
chain.

Level of coverage (column 2)
• Select “Organization-wide” if the level of coverage applies to your entire organization, e.g.,
if the policy is applied at the corporate level rather than a geographical or facility level.
Otherwise, choose another option and provide more details and an explanation in column
4 “Explain the coverage”.
Value chain stages covered (column 3)
• Indicate the stages of the value chain covered in the content of your policy, e.g., whether
the content dropdowns selected in column 5 “Environmental policy content” extend to
stages of the value chain beyond your direct operations.
• This is different from column 2 “Level of coverage”, as the former refers to the scope of
the policy, while this column requests information on whether the contents of the policy,
i.e. commitments, only address your direct operations or also other parts of your value
chain. For example, an organization could have an organization-wide policy that only
relates to their direct operations, and a country-specific environmental policy that extends
to upstream value chain (i.e., their suppliers).
• If some response options in column 5 “Environmental policy content” only apply to a
particular value chain stage, add rows as applicable; e.g., if you have one organization-
wide policy but different commitments apply to different stages of your value chain.
Explain the coverage (column 4)
• Briefly describe the coverage of your environmental policy and provide reasons.
• If applicable, specify which biomes or ecoregions are covered by your policy, e.g.,
Cerrado biome.
• Indicate whether there are exclusions to the coverage of your policy e.g., geographical
areas, business activities etc. If there are exclusions, provide the reasons.
Attach the policy (column 8)
• This column is optional if you select “Not publicly available” in column “Public availability”.

Environmental Issue Question level CC, F, W, B
(Theme)
Sector Question level All
(4.7) Does the policy framework for the portfolio activities of your organization include
environmental requirements that clients/investees need to meet, and/or exclusion policies?
Question details
Question This question only appears if you select “Yes” in response to column 1 “Activity undertaken” in
dependencies any row of 1.10.
This question is NOT shown if “Yes” is selected in column 1 “Activity undertaken” for row
“Insurance underwriting (Insurance company)” and “Life and/or health” is the ONLY selection in
column 2 “Insurance types underwritten” .
Change from last New question for Biodiversity
year Modified question for Climate change, Forests and Water (2023 C-FS3.6, FW-FS3.5)
Rationale Considering environmental issues in an organization’s policy framework is an important element
of business strategy and a signal of how deeply environmental issues are embedded in an
organization’s processes. For these reasons, data users are interested in understanding
whether organizations in the financial services sector have integrated environmental
requirements for clients/investees, and whether financial institutions have implemented any
environmental exclusion policies.
Ambition • The organization has publicly available policies which address environmental
dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities related to the organization and its value
chain.
• The policies apply organization-wide, and to the organization’s value chain where relevant.
• Financial institutions have policies which include environmental requirements that
clients/investees need to meet.
• Financial institutions shall commit, via a publicly available policy, to the immediate cessation
of:
o All new financial services to projects and companies involved in new coal mines,
extensions/expansions of coal mines, or new unabated coal-fired power plants
(inclusive of electric utilities and industrial use cases), with the exception of new
financing for permanent decommissioning of production activities and capacity; and
o All new financial services to new long-lead time upstream oil and gas projects and
mid-stream infrastructure dedicated to new long-lead time upstream oil and gas
projects.
o The applicability of abatement for the purpose of the arrest of financial services to
new unabated coal-fired power plants is considered to be at least a 90% reduction
of scope 1 and 2 emissions from the associated coal assets of the holding company
or project. For carbon capture to be considered part of the 90%, it must be (i)
utilized for mitigation products that have century-scale (or greater) lifetimes (i.e.,
geological carbon capture and storage); and (ii) must not support processes that
enable continued fossil fuel extraction and/or development of production capacity.

(4.7.1) Provide details of the policies which include environmental requirements that
clients/investees need to meet.
Question details
Question This question only appears if you select “Yes, our policies include environmental requirements
dependencies that clients/investees need to meet” or “Yes, our framework includes both policies with
client/investee requirements and environmental exclusion policies” in response to column 1
“Policy framework for portfolio activities include environmental requirements for
clients/investees, and/or exclusion policies” of 4.7.
Change from last New question for Biodiversity
year Modified question for Climate change, Forests and Water (2023 C-FS3.6a, FW-FS3.5a)
Rationale To help manage environmental risks, organizations should integrate environmental issues into
existing policy frameworks. These policies may apply across the organization and may be
based on sectors, geographies, business lines, asset classes or other. Although the wave of
environmental policies and regulations is growing, their implementation varies across
organizations. This question helps data users understand which corporate policies integrate
environmental issues, and what proportion of a financial services company’s portfolio is covered
by the policy.
Ambition
• The organization has publicly available policies which address environmental
dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities related to the organization and its value
chain.
• The policies apply organization-wide, and to the organization’s value chain where relevant.
• The organization specifies whether and how its policies are linked to absolute and interim
timebound, quantifiable and measurable targets that include reference dates/cut-off
dates/boundaries/coverage/exclusions.
• Financial institutions have policies which include environmental requirements that
clients/investees need to meet.

Rationale Exclusion policies are an element of financial sector companies’ negative screening processes
to reduce portfolio exposure to environmentally vulnerable projects and/or investments, and to
implement environmental commitments. Data users are interested in understanding the types of
environmental policy exclusions and the effect that these exclusions have had or will have on
the organizations’ exposure.
Ambition • The organization specifies whether and how its policies are linked to absolute and interim
timebound, quantifiable and measurable targets that include reference dates/cut-off
dates/boundaries/coverage/exclusions.
• The organization endorses or aligns its environmental policies and commitments to the
most recent and widely accepted scientific interpretation of relevant global environmental
treaties, policy goals (e.g., the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, Paris
Agreement, Sustainable Development Goals, Planetary Boundaries), and identifies where
and how they align.

Rationale Banks can influence their clients through requirements within the terms of financing
agreements and with the option of a default being triggered should there be a failure to
comply. Data users are interested in whether banks are using this to enforce their
environmental policies and promote action on environmental performance, including a
perceived improvement in credit profile and access to alternative pools of capital.
Ambition • Banks have covenants in financing agreements to reinforce environmental policies.

Rationale By becoming a signatory of environmental collaborative industry initiatives, organizations
contribute to the development of environmental disclosure frameworks, metrics, and goals that
will help transition into a more sustainable economy. Supporting environmental industry
initiatives sends a signal to investors about the organization’s commitment to taking steps to
align its business with this transition. Endorsing widely known public initiatives reflects good
practice and meets data users’ demand for environmental action, as organizations have the
opportunity to benchmark themselves against their peers.

Public policy engagement
(4.11) In the reporting year, did your organization engage in activities that could directly or
indirectly influence policy, law, or regulation that may (positively or negatively) impact the
environment?
Page 211 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

Question details
Change from last New question for Forests
year
Modified question for Climate change and Water (2023 C12.3, W6.5, W6.5a)
Rationale Data users wish to understand how an organization’s policy engagement on environmental
issues relates to other stances taken. It is important that organizations maintain a consistent
approach to environmental issues – for instance, engaging in activities whose purpose is to
discredit environmental science, while also collaborating with other groups to advance solutions
for environmental issues sends conflicting messages to data users about that organization’s
priorities and stance.
This question provides data users with insights into the different external engagement activities
of organizations and enables organizations to disclose the processes they use to ensure that
their position on environmental issues is compatible with the positive contributions in which they
partake, as well as with global environmental treaties or goals.
Ambition
• The organization assesses which of its policy engagement activities (positively or
negatively) impact the environment and how they relate to the environmental dependencies,
impacts, risks, and opportunities that it has identified. The organization discloses:
o Which engagement activities impact the environment and how.
o How the policy engagement activity relates to the organization’s environmental
dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities.
• The organization publishes a public commitment or position statement to conduct their
public policy engagement activities in line with the most recent and widely accepted
scientific interpretation of global environmental treaties and policy goals (e.g., the Paris
Agreement, the Sustainable Development Goals, or the Kunming-Montreal Global
Biodiversity Framework).
• The organization is registered on one or more transparency registers and discloses details
to enable identification of the organization in the register.

• If you are engaging with multiple policies as part of a policy package, you may group this into a
single row. If you are only engaging in part of a policy package, specify which parts you are
engaging with and respond to the question based only on the parts you engage with rather than
Page 216 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

the whole policy package (e.g., if you are engaging with policymakers on the EU Fit for 55
package, you may report this in a single row).
• If you are engaging with multiple policies related to a single topic as part of a focus area or
engagement strategy (e.g., if you have a water policy strategy engaging with multiple policies
related to water), you may group these into a single row.
• If you are engaging on the same policies in multiple jurisdictions (e.g., if you are engaging with
emissions trading schemes in multiple countries), you may group these into a single row.
• There is no need to provide details on all legislation that your organization has engaged with
policy makers on – only those on which you have been actively engaging in the reporting year.
Focus area of policy, law, or regulation that may impact the environment (column 3a, column 3b)
• Select the specific focus area from one of the following general categories:
o Environmental impacts and pressures – policies focusing on issues and risks that
change the state of nature.
o Energy and renewables – policies related to energy generation and a transition to
clean energy.
o Environmental protection and management procedures – policies related to the
protection of landscapes and improving land and water management practices to halt
and reduce negative impacts on nature.
o Financial mechanisms (e.g., taxes, subsidies, etc.) – policies for using market
signals to promote sustainable business practices and put a cost on emitting
greenhouse gases and negative impact on nature.
o Low-impact production and innovation – policies related to products, services, and
business models with lower GHG emissions and less impact on nature.
o Social issues – policies related to topics and issues that influence the rights and
wellbeing of people.
o Transparency and due diligence – policies related to processes that demonstrate
organizations are aware of and are managing their environmental impact.
o Other – any other policies, including those related to transport, construction & housing,
targets and transition plans, international agreements related to climate change
mitigation and adaptation, and Small and Medium Sized Enterprises.
Country/area/region the policy, law or regulation applies to (column 5)
• This column only appears if “Regional”, “National”, “Sub-national” is selected in column 4
“Geographic coverage of policy, law, or regulation”.
• Refer to the CDP Technical Note: Countries, Areas and Regions for details of the available
regions and their constituent countries/areas.
• If the policy, law, or regulation is at the sub-national level, select “Other, please specify” and
specify the region(s) within a nation to which it applies.
Your organization’s position on the policy, law, or regulation (column 6)
• This should reflect your organization’s overall position on this particular legislation. For example:
o “Oppose” – select this option if you have been engaging against this legislation across
all relevant geographies.
o “Neutral” – select this option if you have taken part in engagement activities for this
legislation but have not put forward a view.
o “Support with no exceptions” – select this option if you are engaging in full support of
this legislation across all the geographies in which you are engaging on it.
o “Support with minor exceptions” – select this option if you are engaging in support of
this legislation with either minor exceptions to the approach or with minor exceptions to
geographies for whom it is proposed and where you are actively engaging. For
example, if you support the principle of a carbon tax but oppose certain ways in which
it is being applied, select this option. You will be given the chance to explain any
exceptions in column 7 “Details of any exceptions and your organization’s proposed
alternative approach to the policy, law, or regulation.
o “Support with major exceptions” – select this option if you are engaging in support of
this legislation with either major exceptions to the approach or with major exceptions to
geographies for whom it is proposed and where you are actively engaging.
Page 217 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

o “Undecided” – select this option if you have been engaging in this legislation at an early
stage in the development process and have yet to give an opinion or attempt to
influence the policy development process in any direction.
Details of any exceptions and your organization’s proposed alternative approach to the policy, law,
or regulation (column 7)
• This column only appears if “Support with minor exceptions”, “Support with major exceptions”,
or “Oppose” is selected in column 6 “Your organization’s position on the policy, law, or
regulation.”
• If your organization supports the legislation with exceptions, provide details of the exceptions
and what you would propose in their place.
• If your organization opposes the legislation, provide details of an alternative legislative approach
that you feel would more effectively address relevant environmental issues in the corporate
sector. For example, if you support mandatory environmental reporting but oppose its schedule
for implementation, you should propose an alternative legislative timeframe for the
implementation of mandatory environmental reporting.
Type of direct engagement with policy makers on this policy, law, or regulation (column 8)
• If you provided funding or in-kind (non-financial) support to policy makers in the reporting year
but have not engaged directly on specific policies, select “Provided funding or in-kind support”.
Funding figure your organization provided to policy makers in the reporting year relevant to this
policy, law, or regulation (currency) (column 9)
• This figure should be relevant to the specific policy, law, or regulation reported in this row. If you
have engaged with the same policy maker on multiple policies, laws, or regulations, but your
funding is not specific to each policy, disaggregate the figure between the policies based on an
estimation of the time spent engaging in each policy.
• Enter 0 if your organization has not provided funding to policy makers relevant to this policy,
law, or regulation in the reporting year.
• This figure should be in the same currency that you selected in 1.2 for all financial information
disclosed throughout your response.
Explain the relevance of this policy, law, or regulation to the achievement of your environmental
commitments and/or transition plan, how this has informed your engagement, and how you
measure the success of your engagement (column 10)
• This description should include the positive and/or negative impacts you anticipate the policy,
law, or regulation will have on your organization’s public commitments and/or transition plan,
and how you intend to influence this through engagement.
• If your engagement is of particular importance to specific river basins or priority locations you
have identified, provide details of why.
• Include the outcomes you intend to achieve through the engagement, and how you measure
whether you are on track to achieving them.
• If applicable, include any metrics and/or indicators you will use to quantify the success of your
engagement.
Indicate if you have evaluated whether your organization’s engagement on this policy, law, or
regulation is aligned with global environmental treaties or policy goals (column 11)
• Alignment with the goals of the Paris Agreement: refers to the Paris Agreement long-term
temperature goal (United Nations), as expressed in relevant IPCC reports, in particular the IPCC
Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) and the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C
(SR1.5).
• Alignment with the goals of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework: refers
to the four long-term goals for 2050 (CBD, 2023), including the goal to ensure that the integrity,
connectivity and resilience of all ecosystems are maintained, enhanced, or restored,
substantially increasing the area of natural ecosystems by 2050. When evaluating alignment
with the Global Biodiversity Framework, it is particularly important to consider alignment with
Target 18 on harmful incentives and Target 19 on increasing financial resources.
• Alignment with Sustainable Development Goal 6 on Clean Water and Sanitation: refers to
alignment specifically with Goal 6 from the seventeen goals for 2030 set out in the UN’s
Page 218 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

Sustainable Development Goals. Alignment means that your engagement is aligned with the
targets and indicators associated with SDG 6 (e.g., Target 6.1 on achieving universal and
equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all; Target 6.3 on improving water
quality through means including reducing pollution).
• If you select “Yes, we have evaluated, and it is aligned with another global environmental treaty
or policy goal, please specify”, provide a label for the global environmental treaty or policy goal.
• Engagement that is aligned with global environmental treaties and policy goals could include,
for example:
o Support of legislation that aims to reduce emissions or limit environmental impact in line
with global treaties or policy goals e.g., government subsidies on electric vehicles and
associated implementation technology to reduce emissions; due diligence requirements
to prevent commodities sourced from land that has been illegally converted entering
supply chains; requirements for monitoring priority substances in freshwater bodies.
o Opposition of legislation that risks derailing global treaties or policy goals e.g.,
legislative approval of new fossil fuel extraction or generation facilities in a particular
jurisdiction; legislation reducing the area where it is illegal to convert natural land;
legislative approval of new mining project considered to be a threat to nearby water
sources.

(Theme)
Sector Question level All
(4.11.2) Provide details of your indirect engagement on policy, law, or regulation that may
(positively or negatively) impact the environment through trade associations or other intermediary
organizations or individuals in the reporting year.
Question details
Question This question only appears if you select “Yes, we engaged indirectly through, and/or provided
dependencies financial or in-kind support to a trade association or other intermediary organization or individual
whose activities could influence policy, law, or regulation” in response to column 1 “External
engagement activities that could directly or indirectly influence policy, law, or regulation that
may impact the environment” of 4.11.
Change from last New question for Forests and Water
year Modified question for Climate change (2023 C12.3b, C12.3c)
Rationale Organizations have many potential avenues for engagement activities. Trade associations are a
tool through which organizations can shape policy and interact with legislators and industry
peers. Engaging with, or providing support to, other intermediary organizations or individuals
can play an important role in the development and adoption of environmental policy. As such,
data users expect organizations to be transparent about the full range of their engagement and
funding activities as well as their relationship and responsibilities with intermediary
organizations that are likely to take a position on legislation or that could influence policy, law, or
regulation that may impact the environment.
Ambition
• The organization assesses which of its policy engagement activities (positively or
negatively) impact the environment and how they relate to the environmental dependencies,
impacts, risks, and opportunities that it has identified. The organization discloses:
o Which engagement activities impact the environment and how.
o How the policy engagement activity relates to the organization’s environmental
dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities.
• The organization reports the monetary value of direct and indirect financial and in-kind
political contributions and where estimates were used, how these were estimated (such as
Page 219 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

total monetary amount of such internal and external expenses and/or the total amount paid
for membership to lobbying associations, for its contributions).
• The organization conducts a review of its trade associations’ positions on environmental
issues and discloses any actions it took as a result of the review. The organization takes
action to address misalignment by publicly opposing negative environmental positions, by
staying and influencing change within the trade association, and/or by terminating their
membership with the trade association.

Module 5: Business Strategy
Guidance for companies reporting on Climate change, Forests, Water Security on behalf of investors &
supply chain members.
The full reporting guidance including explanation of terms is available via the portal/public guidance page.
Module overview
Module CDP data users are interested in organizations’ forward-looking strategies, and financial decisions
Overview that are driven by future market opportunities, public policy objectives, and corporate responsibilities
related to the environment.
This module allows organizations to disclose whether they have acted upon integrating
environmental issues into their business strategy. It includes questions on scenario analysis, and
transition plans, which are tools for organizations to understand strategic implications of
environmental risks and opportunities. In addition, the module comprises questions on the effects of
risks and opportunities on financial and strategic planning, CAPEX/OPEX alignment, and pricing of
environmental externalities.
The module also requests information about environmental requirements for asset managers and
shareholder voting (sections 5.14 and 5.15) targeted at the financial services sector only, and
contains questions on collaborative opportunities (section 5.12 and 5.13) shown only to
organizations responding to a request from a CDP Supply Chain members.
Disclosure note Scenario analysis and transition planning disclosure was piloted by CDP in the Assessing Low-
Carbon Transition (ACT) initiative in 2016. Further information on conducting and disclosing
scenario analysis can be found in the CDP Technical Note on Scenario Analysis. Further
information on transition planning can be found in the CDP Climate Transition Plan Technical
note.
• Responses given in this module should be relevant to the reporting period, even if revisions
have been made to your strategy between the reporting period and the time of submission of
your CDP response. Where this is the case, you can include more up to date information in the
FI field at the end of the questionnaire (Module 13). This will not be scored but will be available
to data users viewing your response.

• This column is only presented if either “No…” option is selected in column 1 “Use
of scenario analysis”.
• Provide an organization-specific explanation of why you do not use environment-
related scenario analysis to inform your strategy and outline any plans to do so in the
future.
• If you selected “Judged to be unimportant”, explain the criteria used to decide
that environment-related scenario analysis is not important for your organization.
• If you selected “Lack of internal resources”, specify whether this relates to lack of
internal expertise, data availability, funds to outsource the analysis or other
resources.
Additional • The TCFD Guidance on Scenario Analysis for Non-Financial Companies identifies two
information main types of scenarios: (1) exploratory scenarios used to explore a range of different
possible futures and (2) normative scenarios used to plan for a preferred future. The
essential difference is that with normative scenarios, scenario analysis begins with a
desired future outcome and works backward to inform decisions on what is needed to
achieve that outcome. With exploratory scenarios, the scenario analysis instead begins
from the present, and then describes a diverse set of plausible future states.
• Normative scenarios are typically used for assessment and setting of specific targets and
implementation plans, while exploratory scenarios are used to assess potential climate-
related risks and uncertainties and test the resiliency of various strategies to a wide range
of future conditions. The TCFD recommends the use of an exploratory approach.
• The TNFD Guidance on scenario analysis provides guidance for organizations who choose
to use scenario analysis to explore the possible consequences of nature loss and climate
change.

users with an indication of the extent to which your organization is considering a range of
Page 231 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

possible and probable futures when considering environmental challenges and opportunities in
your business strategy.
Ambition • The organization describes how the scenarios chosen were developed, including:
o Sources of scenarios used and rationale for the choice;
o Narratives and constraints including inputs, assumptions and uncertainties; and
o Time-horizons considered.
• The scenario analysis performed includes the following:
o The chosen assumptions, narratives and time horizons should be robust and
internally consistent. I.e., they should:
▪ Be consistent with critical environmental assumptions made in the
organization’s strategy and financial planning; and
▪ Be relevant to and cover the organization’s plausible dependencies,
impacts, risks, and opportunities.
o A range of scenarios covering all environmental topics that are relevant to the
organization, including quantitative and qualitative components. For example,
changing hydrological patterns, changes in water use/exploitation, land use
change, and socio-economic changes. Consider ecological thresholds and
tipping points where possible.
o Consideration of interdependencies between environmental scenarios.
o A nature-wide analysis approach where feasible.
• Climate-scenario analysis should include:
o At least one 1.5°C or lower scenario for organization-wide climate transition risk
assessment;
o At least one high emission scenario (3°C or higher) for organization-wide
physical risk assessment, with location-based analysis specific to the
organization's locations where possible; and
o The decarbonization scenarios used should be from credible, well recognized
sources (e.g., International Energy Agency (IEA)).
• (Financial Services sector) Companies in the financial services sector use a range of
scenarios as part of their scenario analysis, focusing on climate risks associated with
their financing activities (lending, investing and insurance underwriting), at least one of
which is a 1.5ºC temperature aligned scenario.

Requested content General
• Add a row for each scenario, or scenario variation, used in your scenario analysis.
• For climate-related scenario analysis, as recommended by TCFD, scenarios should be
sufficiently diverse to allow challenging “what-if” analyses and capture a wide range of
insights about uncertain futures. In assessing transition risks, an organization should
consider using or developing a 1.5°C scenario. In assessing physical risks, an organization
should use the current GHG pathway based on government policies currently in place,
which according to latest estimates from the Climate Action Tracker would result in
warming of about 2.7°C above pre-industrial levels. 2.7°C is the median of the low and high
ends of current policy projections.
• Organizations using customized or bespoke scenarios should have a robust and
accountable process to ensure that the scenarios used are objective and diverse, and
should transparently disclose this process and the content of the scenarios in this
question.
• The CDP Technical Note on Scenario Analysis provides further guidance on conducting
and disclosing scenario analysis.
Environmental issue this scenario has been used to analyze (column 0)
• A row will automatically be added to this column for each environmental issue you select
“Yes” in question 5.1.
Scenario used (column 1)
• Note that a scenario linked to one environmental issue can be used in the scenario analysis
of another. For instance, a climate change scenario can be used to analyze outcomes for
forests.
• If you have based your scenario on a publicly available one but adjusted it for the purposes
of your analysis, please select the relevant “Customized publicly available...” option.
SSPs used in conjunction with scenario (column 2)
• This column only appears if you select a RCP scenario in the “Scenario used” column.
• By design, the RCP emission and concentration pathways were stripped of their
association with a certain socio-economic development. Shared Socio-economic
Pathways (SSPs) have been developed to complement them. SSP1, SSP2, …, SSP5 are
used to denote the five socio-economic scenario families used in conjunction with the
RCPs.
Reference year (column 7)
• The reference year is the designated start date for the scenario.
Timeframes covered (column 8)
• Select all times horizons covered (example: if your time horizon is up to 2045, select up to
2040).
Driving forces in scenario (column 9)
• Specify the key external factors that influence the events, trends, and patterns that
determine the outcomes in the scenario.
• Consult the TNFD Guidance on scenario analysis for further information on the driving
forces presented in this column.
Assumptions, uncertainties and constraints in scenario (column 10)
• Outline the major assumptions your organization has made regarding:
Page 235 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

o Policies in the jurisdictions covered by the scenario;
o Macroeconomic trends;
o National- or regional-level variables (e.g. local weather patterns, demographics,
land use, infrastructure and availability of natural resources);
o Developments in technology and;
o Energy usage and mix.
• Discuss the assumptions your organization has made on the severity or intensity of the
driving forces identified in column 10 “Driving forces in scenario”.
• Highlight the uncertainties and constraints that may affect the outcomes of the scenario
analysis.
• If the scenario does not cover your entire organization, provide further details of the
coverage.
Rationale for choice of scenario (column 11)
• Describe why the chosen scenario is relevant to the resilience of your organization's
business strategy, and how it aligns with critical assumptions in your organization's strategy
and financial planning.
• If disclosing on climate change, include why the scenarios are relevant to assessing your
organization’s resilience to climate-related changes, developments or uncertainties.
Specify if any of the climate-related scenarios used were aligned with the latest
international agreement on climate change.
• Provide further details on the sources of the scenarios used, including data sources and
models used if applicable.
• Financial services sector companies should state if your organization uses environmental
scenario analysis to understand the impact of environmental issues on lending, financial
intermediary, investment and/or insurance underwriting activities, in addition to operational
activities.
Requested content Note for companies in the financial services sector
– [sector] • Note that “Organization-wide” in column 3 “Scenario coverage” refers to the reporting
(if applicable) boundary as disclosed in the introduction module. Financial services sector companies
using scenario analysis on their portfolios should select “Portfolio”, even when the scenario
covers all financial activities and portfolios. In column “Scenario coverage”, select
“Company-wide” if referring to direct operations AND portfolio activities related to lending,
investing and or insurance. Select “Company-wide excluding portfolio” if referring only to
your direct operations and nothing related to your lending, insurance and investing
activities.
• Both physical and transition pathway risks should be considered in your scenario analysis.
• Banks:
o Banks are encouraged to use the Network for Greening the Financial System
(NGFS) scenarios framework.
• Insurance companies:
o Insurance companies that perform climate-related scenario analysis on their
underwriting activities should provide the following information:
▪ Information on the time frames used for the climate-related scenarios,
including short-, medium-, and long-term milestone; and
▪ Companies with substantial exposure to weather-related perils should
consider a greater than 2°C scenario to account for physical effects of
climate change.

Transition plans
(5.2) Does your organization’s strategy include a climate transition plan?
Question details
Change from last Modified question (2023 C3.1)
year
Rationale Developing a climate transition plan provides certainty to data users that an organization is
aligning to the long-term, global climate goals and that its business model will continue to be
relevant in a net-zero carbon economy. Collecting feedback on the climate transition plan
allows shareholders to review and raise resolutions related to progress. This question provides
transparency regarding an organization’s transition plans and associated feedback
mechanisms.
Ambition • The organization has a publicly available 1.5°C-aligned climate transition plan in
place.
Page 239 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

• The organization discloses the key assumptions used in developing its transition plan
and anything that the transition plan is reliant upon.
• The transition plan has a well-defined feedback mechanism in place, where relevant
stakeholders can provide input. For example, a shareholder vote at an organization's
AGM.
• The transition plan is developed in the context of a robust climate-related and, where
relevant, other environmental dependencies, impacts, risk and opportunities
assessment. The plan should demonstrate how the organization intends on managing
climate-related dependencies and impacts whilst mitigating identified risks and
realizing identified opportunities.
• The transition plan is supported by credible science-based targets (i.e., 1.5°C-aligned
and net zero targets), and progress against these targets should be measurable and
disclosed.
• The organization outlines the decarbonization levers they plan to use, and the plan
outlines the mitigation and adaptation actions they need to take now and in the future
to achieve the goals of the transition plan and meet the associated targets. This
includes actions both within their own operations and throughout the value chain,
including changes to products and services, changes in business model and
engagement strategies e.g. procurement strategy, policy engagement strategy.
• The transition plan contains verifiable and quantifiable key performance indicators
(KPIs) which measure the success of an organization’s climate transition and are
tracked regularly.
• The organization has developed a plan for how the actions needed to achieve the
transition plan objectives will be resourced (i.e., where the investment for the
implementation of the plan will come from), and any preconditions to this financing.
• The organization leverages sustainable finance instruments, where possible. For
example, the organization may use sustainable finance taxonomies to identify products
and services they should invest in to achieve the transition plan objectives.

Requested content General
• A credible transition plan refers to a plan which contains relevant information on how your
organizations plans on achieving your strategy to pivot your existing assets, operations, and
entire business model towards a trajectory aligned with the latest and most ambitious
Page 241 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

climate science recommendations. i.e., halving greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030
and reaching net zero by 2050 at the latest, thereby limiting global warming to 1.5°C.
• CDP recommends that a transition plan is succinctly integrated into existing mainstream
filings and provides a well-defined feedback mechanism. It should also be publicly
available.
• Please refer to the CDP Climate Transition Plan technical note for more details on transition
plans.
Temperature alignment of transition plan (column 2)
• This column only appears if you select “No, but we have a climate transition plan with a
different temperature alignment” in column 1 “Transition plan”.
• If your organization’s transition plan does not align to any of the options displayed or you do
not know if your transition plan is aligned to the options, select “Other, please specify” and
provide details.
Publicly available climate transition plan (column 3)
• This column is only presented if “Yes, we have a climate transition plan…” or “No, but we
have a climate transition plan with a different temperature alignment” is selected in column 1
“Transition plan”.
Plan explicitly commits to cease all spending on, and revenue generation from, activities
that contribute to fossil fuel expansion (column 4)
• Any activity that increases the demand for fossil fuels is considered as contributing to fossil
fuel expansion.
• Spending includes any capital or operational expenditure linked to fossil fuel expansion;
examples include, but are not limited to;
• Investment in infrastructure for extraction of fossil fuels e.g. oil and gas wells, pipelines,
liquefied natural gas terminal etc.;
• Investment in new fossil fuel power plants;
• Investment in research and development of products that rely on fossil fuels to
function;
• New capital goods such as ships, factories, cement kilns, blast furnaces, and
others, which have medium to long lifetimes and lack the capability to be
retrofitted with alternative power sources to fossil fuels;
• Construction and operation of buildings with inefficient energy systems that will
result in the increased use of fossil fuels; and
• Investment in new internal combustion engine vehicles for transportation
services.
• Revenue generated from activities that directly or indirectly supports fossil fuel expansion,
examples include but are not limited to;
• Sale of internal combustion engine vehicles, directly contributing to fossil fuel
demand;
• Revenue generated from consultation on projects associated with non-renewable
energy infrastructure;
• Operating a transport system primarily run on fossil fuels;
• Revenue generated from data centres powered by non-renewable energy
sources; and
• Revenue generated from petrochemical products e.g. plastics, fertilizers,
pesticides, explosives etc.

organization’s climate transition plan.
• Only select “Our climate transition plan is voted on at Annual General Meetings (AGMs)” if
your climate transition plan is a standing item at your AGMs. Note that this option is
applicable even if your climate transition plan is already in progress, as it should be
continually adjusted and voted on by shareholders (rather than a one-time sign-off).
Furthermore, shareholders should be given the opportunity to provide feedback on progress
made against your climate transition plan.
Description of feedback mechanism (column 8)
• This column is only presented if “We have a different feedback mechanism in place”, or “Our
climate transition plan is voted on at AGMs and we also have an additional feedback

Requested General
content • This question is intended to focus on the group business strategy – meaning
your organization (as defined in 1.5). However, if it is more appropriate, you may wish
to comment on divisional (business unit) strategies and specify where this is the
case.
• If your strategy relating to a particular business area has been affected by risks
and/or opportunities differently across the environmental issues considered,
add a row and explain the difference in column 4. For example, if forests-
related risks have affected your operations strategy but both risks and
opportunities relating to climate have affected your operations strategy,
disclose this across separate rows.
• If your risks and/or opportunities have affected your strategy relating to a business
area for the individual environmental issues differently, add a row for each. For
example, if your climate-related and water-related risks have affected your operations
differently, then disclose these in different rows. Whereas, if your climate-related and
water-related risks affected your operations in the same way, then disclose these in
the same row.
• If you are responding to a request from a Supply Chain member, include
information specific to your requesting member, i.e. relevant business units.
Environmental issues relevant to the risks and/or opportunities that have influenced
your strategy in this area (column 3)

type”, and column 1 “Environmental risks/opportunities identified” of 3.1 and
3.6.
Describe how environmental risks and/or opportunities have affected your strategy in this area
(column 3)
• Using organization-specific examples where relevant, describe how the
business area in column 1 was affected, including;
o The risks and/or opportunities disclosed in 3.1.1 / 3.6.1 that have
affected the business area and why the decision was taken (e.g. to
avoid loss in revenue, to exploit new markets);
o The time horizons over which your business strategy in this area has
been affected by environmental risks and/or opportunities;
o The most substantial decisions in this area that have been affected by
risks and/or opportunities; and
o How your organization makes and implements strategic decisions. For
example, you may have decided to introduce a new product range or
Page 248 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

cease the manufacturing of a particular product, divest from a location,
or increase capital expenditure on new technologies. You may use the
mitigation hierarchy to detail these decisions and explain why this
decision was taken. For example, to benefit from increased asset
valuations; to exploit new markets; because of a projected lack of
resource availability; or because of anticipated consumer behavior
shifts. More details on the mitigation hierarchy can be found on p.38 of
the TNFD recommendations
o If relevant, details on how dependencies and impacts have affected your
organization’s strategy;
• Include where in your organization’s strategy risks and opportunities are
concentrated (for example, geographical areas, facilities and type of assets).
• Include current and anticipated changes to your organization’s business model,
including resource allocation, to address environment-related risks and opportunities
(for example, these changes could include plans to manage or decommission carbon-
, energy- or water-intensive operations; resource allocations resulting from demand or
upstream value-chain changes; resource allocations arising from business
development through capital expenditure or additional expenditure on research and
development; and acquisitions or divestments). This may also include current and
anticipated changes in policies or efforts to mitigate environmental risks, manage
issues and/or contribute towards the goals and targets in the Kunming-Montreal
Global Biodiversity Framework, Paris Agreement or Sustainable Development Goals.
• Detail how your organization plans to achieve, if they have been set, any
environment-related targets and, if relevant, targets you are required to meet by
law or regulation.

o Responding direct and indirect adaptation and mitigation activities.
• If disclosing on climate change, include the effect of climate-related risks and/or
opportunities on your climate transition plans and how it has resulted in changes to
your strategy.
• If disclosing on forests, specify whether your plans apply to all of your disclosed
commodities or to only a selection of them. If your plans do not apply to all your
commodities, please provide your reasons here.
Requested • Note for organizations with coal reserves:
content – [sector] o Organizations with coal reserves can refer to CDP Technical Note: Guidance for
(if applicable) companies with coal reserves on how to disclose demand and stranded asset risk.
• Note for electric utility sector organizations:

Requested General
content • This question is intended to focus on the group financial planning– meaning your organization
(as defined in 1.5). However, if it is more appropriate, you may wish to comment on divisional
(business unit) financial planning and specify where this is the case.
• If your financial planning elements have been affected by risks and/or opportunities differently
across the environmental issues considered, add a row and explain the difference in column
4. For example, if forests-related opportunities have affected your revenue but both climate
related risks and opportunities have affected your revenue, disclose this across separate
rows.
• If your risks and/or opportunities have affected your financial planning relating to a financial
planning element for the individual environmental issues differently, add a row for each. For
example, if your climate-related and water-related risks have affected your capital expenditure
differently, then disclose these in different rows. Whereas, if your climate-related and water-
related risks impacted your capital expenditure in the same way, then disclose these in the
same row.
• If a financial services sector discloser, the environmental risks and/or opportunities to be
considered in this question refer to lending, financial intermediary, investment and/or
insurance underwriting activities of your organization, in addition to your operational activities.
Describe how environmental risks and opportunities have affected these financial planning
elements (column 4)
• Describe how your organization’s financial planning element(s) have been affected by
environmental risks and/or opportunities. This may include:
o How environmental risks and/or opportunities serve as an input into financial planning
processes for the financial planning elements selected;
o How your organization’s resourcing, resource allocation and plans to resource, may
change due to your organization’s investment and disposal plans and funding of
strategies to respond to environmental risks and/or opportunities;
o A case study for at least one of the elements selected, including details of the risks or
opportunities disclosed in 3.1.1 and 3.6.1 that have affected the financial planning
element selected in column 1 “Financial planning elements that have been affected”,
and how.
o The time horizons over which your financial planning in this area has been affected by
environmental risks and/or opportunities, using organization-specific examples where
relevant.
o Details on how your organization plans to fund the strategies to achieve the
environmental commitments and targets that you have set and any targets you are
required to meet by law or regulation.
• Note for climate change disclosers:
o If you are planning to resource emissions reduction initiatives, detail how you are
planning to do so.
o If you have reported that your organization has a climate transition plan in 5.2, provide
details of how you plan to resource the different aspects of the climate transition plan.
• Note for forests disclosers. Consider if the following issues have affected your financial
planning:
o Eliminating or reducing deforestation and conversion of natural ecosystems from your
direct operations and upstream value chain;
o Promoting ecosystem restoration and/or conservation in your direct operations and
upstream value chain (e.g. to remedy past deforestation or conversion); and
o Increasing the sustainable production and/or consumption of commodities.
Requested Note for the financial services sector
content – [sector] • For banks:
(if applicable) o Describe the potential financial effects of the identified environmental risks and/or
opportunities on your core businesses, products and services. For example, you may
do this by translating risk data into probability of default, total committed exposure
and/or exposure at default.
• For asset managers/asset owners:
o Where appropriate, describe how environmental risks and/or opportunities may affect
the financial returns of relevant products or investment strategies.
Page 252 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

o Asset managers should also describe how each product or investment strategy might
be affected by the transition to a lower-carbon economy.
• For insurance companies:
o Describe the potential financial effects of environmental risks and opportunities on
your core businesses, products and services. For example, you may do this by
translating risk data into probability of default and/or exposure at default.
o As asset owners, insurance companies should describe how environmental risks and
opportunities may affect the financial returns of investment strategies. This could be
described from the perspective of the total fund or investment strategy or individual
investment strategies for various asset classes.

Requested content Identification of spending/revenue that is aligned with your organization’s climate transition
(column 1)
• Select “Yes” if, in your financial statements, you identify spending/revenue that is aligned
with your organization’s climate transition, as assessed using any methodology or
framework to track the progress of your climate transition.
• Note that if your organization has a climate transition plan as indicated in 5.2, it is
considered best practice to include within your climate transition plan details of the
methodology/framework used to assess the alignment of your spending/revenue with
your transition.
• It is up to each organization to determine what is considered to be aligned with your
organization’s climate transition. For example:
o Revenue derived from the sale of low-carbon products or services as defined via
recognized taxonomies or methodologies.
o Spending (e.g., CAPEX or OPEX) on the implementation of emissions reduction
initiatives and/or investment in new low-carbon assets or projects.
• You will have the opportunity to provide further details in the subsequent questions.
Methodology or framework used to assess alignment with your organization’s climate transition
(column 2)
• This column only appears if “Yes” is selected in column 1 “Identification of
spending/revenue that is aligned with your organization’s climate transition”.
• Select “A sustainable finance taxonomy” if you use a sustainable finance taxonomy to
assess the alignment of your organization’s spending/revenue with your climate transition
(e.g., the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities).
• Select “Other methodology or framework” if you use a different methodology of
assessment, as disclosed in your climate transition plan (e.g., a self-assessment of your
financial planning against time bound KPIs outlined in your transition plan). You may also
select this option if you do not have a climate transition plan but are using a bespoke
methodology to assess the alignment of your organization’s spending/revenue with your
climate transition.
• If you use a sustainable finance taxonomy to assess some of your organization’s
activities, projects, or assets, and another methodology or framework to assess those
that are not covered by the sustainable finance taxonomy, select both options. For
instance, if you are disclosing against the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities, you
may use a bespoke methodology for assessing the alignment of activities not eligible
under the taxonomy (e.g. wholesale and retail trade, manufacturing of food, beverages
and tobacco etc.).
Indicate the level at which you identify the alignment of your spending/revenue with a sustainable
finance taxonomy (column 3)
• This column only appears if “A sustainable finance taxonomy” is selected in column 2
“Methodology or framework used to assess alignment with your organization’s climate
transition”.
• Select “At the organization level only” if you wish to disclose alignment against a
sustainable finance taxonomy, but the taxonomy does not require alignment information
to be provided at the activity level. For example, you should select this option if the
taxonomy requires a breakdown at project or asset level but not at activity level, or if the
Page 254 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

taxonomy requires just an overall figure at organization company/group level. See
“Explanation of terms” for more information.
• Organizations that wish to disclose alignment against the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable
Activities should select “At both the organization and activity level”.
Additional • Sustainable finance taxonomies are instruments to support the redirection
information
of financial flows towards environmentally (and socially) sustainable
activities. While a coherent disclosure system with internationally agreed
standards and taxonomies is needed to ensure effective data access,
analysis, and use by the data users, CDP’s 2025 strategy has highlighted that
a harmonized taxonomy landscape is crucial to support the investment
decisions of capital market actors and help to prevent greenwash, as laid
out in CDP’s policy brief on sustainable finance taxonomies.
• As a global environmental disclosure system, CDP aims to accelerate the
implementation of sustainable finance taxonomies at scale. This is
reflected in the questions in this module, asking organizations companies
to report the alignment of their business operations and financial
accounting with sustainable finance taxonomies, such as the EU
Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities.
• These questions are taxonomy-agnostic, allowing organizations
companies to provide information on alignment with any sustainable
finance taxonomy. However, additional guidance is provided for
organizations companies choosing to report under the EU Taxonomy for
Sustainable Activities. The following (non-exhaustive) list of sources
contains references to detailed taxonomy disclosure guidance developed
by the EU Commission and the Technical Expert Group on Sustainable
Finance (TEG):

Requested content General
• This question aims to understand your organization’s unique financial pathway
associated with its climate transition.
• It is up to each organization to disclose the relevant financial metrics and methodologies
for identifying the alignment of its expenditures/revenues with its climate transition.
• Note that this question requests information to be provided at the organization level. If
you indicated in column 3 “Indicate the level at which…” of 5.4 that you identify alignment
at both the organization and activity level, you will have the opportunity to provide activity-
level information in the subsequent question, 5.4.2.
• If you are reporting any type of spending on or revenue from low-carbon products and/or
services, specify in column 12 “Details of the methodology…” whether it pertains to
mature technologies or non-mature technologies (e.g., if you finance Emerging Climate
Technologies). If this pertains to both mature and non-mature technologies, provide the
breakdown for these.
• It is acknowledged that figures for future years will be estimates. Assumptions underlying
these estimates should be disclosed in column 12 “Details of the methodology…”.
Methodology or framework used to assess alignment (column 1)
• The options presented in this column depend on your selection in column 2 “Methodology
or framework used…” of 5.4.
• Select the methodology against which you would like to report spending and revenue that
is aligned with your climate transition.
• If the sustainable finance taxonomy used to assess alignment with your organization’s
climate transition does not cover certain activities, projects, or assets in your operations,
add rows to disclose the alignment of your financial metrics according to other
methodologies used by your organization to completement your taxonomy reporting. For
instance, if you are disclosing against the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities, you
may add rows to report alignment against a bespoke methodology for assessing the
alignment of activities not eligible under the taxonomy (e.g. wholesale and retail trade,
manufacturing of food, beverages, and tobacco etc.).
• Provide details of the extent and basis of application of different methodologies to assess
the alignment of your spending/revenue with your organization’s climate transition in
column 12 “Details of the methodology…”.
Page 257 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

Taxonomy under which information if being reported (column 2)
• This column is only presented if “A sustainable finance taxonomy” is selected in column 1
“Methodology or framework used to assess alignment”.
• Add a row for each sustainable finance taxonomy you are providing information for.
• Select “Other, please specify” to provide information for a sustainable finance taxonomy
that is not listed. For further information on alternative sustainable finance taxonomies,
please see CDP’s policy brief.
• If you select “EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities”, note that the reporting period
under the EU Taxonomy is January to December which may differ from the reporting
period indicated in 1.4 relevant to the rest of the CDP questionnaire.
Objective under which alignment is being reported (column 3)
• This column is only presented if “A sustainable finance taxonomy” is selected in column 1
“Methodology or framework used to assess alignment”.
• Add a row for each climate-related objective within the sustainable finance taxonomy you
wish to provide information for. See the Explanation of Terms for more information on
climate change mitigation and adaptation. If the sustainable finance taxonomy does not
require disclosure against specific climate-related objectives, select the objective that
best matches the criteria specified by the taxonomy or report the information as a total by
selecting “Total across climate change mitigation and climate change adaption”.
• Organizations disclosing alignment against the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities
should enter information for each climate-related objective separately. You should also
report total alignment across both climate-related objectives. The figures reported in this
question should be calculated from the “Taxonomy-aligned” information you report at
activity-level in the subsequent question 5.4.2.
Indicate whether you are also reporting eligibility information for the selected objective (column 4)
• This column only appears if “EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities” is selected in
column 1 “Methodology or framework used to assess alignment”.
• Organizations disclosing alignment against the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities
should select “Yes” if they wish to report the share of their financial metrics that are
eligible and non-eligible per objective under the EU Taxonomy.
Financial metric (column 5)
• Add a row for each financial metric you would like to provide information for, or select
“Other, please specify” to provide information for a financial metric that is not listed.
• You can make your response more granular by adding multiple rows and selecting
“Other, please specify”. For example, if in addition to total OPEX, you wish to report
several distinct categories of OPEX (e.g., utilities, business travel, R&D expenses, etc.)
separately, you may do so by adding multiple rows and using “Other, please specify” to
specify the relevant OPEX category.
• Organizations disclosing alignment against the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities
should add a separate row to provide figures for turnover, CAPEX and if relevant, OPEX
associated with each environmental objective separately, and a total across all
objectives. Note that as per the EU Taxonomy Technical Expert Group Report (TEG),
“turnover” and “revenue” are often used interchangeably, and in some contexts, may
mean the same thing, despite there being some technical differences. The term turnover
is most commonly used in Europe and Asia, while the use of the terms revenues or sales
is more common in the United States. Revenue disclosures can therefore be considered
as turnover wherever appropriate.
Amount of selected financial metric that is aligned in the reporting year (column 6)
• Enter the spending/revenue that you consider to be aligned with your organization’s
climate transition as per your chosen methodology/framework as indicated in column 1
“Methodology or framework...”) for this financial metric as an absolute monetary value in
the reporting year.
Page 258 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

• This figure should be based on your organization-wide financial statement for the
reporting year, consistent with your reporting boundary as disclosed in 1.5, and in the
same currency that you selected in question 1.2 for all financial information disclosed
throughout your response.
• Unless your organization is disclosing alignment against a sustainable finance taxonomy
which requires data to be provided for a specific reporting year, the figure provided in this
column should be consistent with the reporting year defined by your answer to 1.4.
• Organizations disclosing alignment against the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities
should provide this figure for a January to December reporting period. If you are
disclosing information under the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities, the figure
reported in this column should meet the requirements of Article 3 of the EU Taxonomy
Regulation.
Percentage share of selected financial metric aligned in the reporting year (%) (column 7)
• Enter the spending/revenue that you consider to be aligned with your organization’s
climate transition as per your chosen methodology/ framework as indicated in column 1
“Methodology or framework...”) for this financial metric as a percentage of your total
spending/revenue for this financial metric in the reporting year.
• This figure should be based on your organization-wide financial statement for the
reporting year, consistent with your reporting boundary as disclosed in 1.5.
• Unless your organization is disclosing alignment against a sustainable finance taxonomy
which requires data to be provided for a specific reporting year, the figure provided in this
column should be consistent with the reporting year defined by your answer to 1.4.
• Organizations disclosing alignment against the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities
should provide this figure for a January to December reporting period. If you are
disclosing information under the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities, the figure
reported in this column should meet the requirements of Article 3 of the EU Taxonomy
Regulation.
Percentage share of selected financial metric planned to align in 2025 (%) (column 8)
• Enter the spending/revenue for this financial metric that you plan to align with your
organization’s climate transition as per your chosen methodology/framework as indicated
in column 1 “Methodology or framework...”) a percentage of your total planned
spending/revenue for this financial metric in 2025.
Percentage share of selected financial metric planned to align in 2030 (%) (column 9)
• Enter the spending/revenue for this financial metric that you plan to align with your
organization’s climate transition as per your chosen methodology/framework as indicated
in column 1 “Methodology or framework...”) as a percentage of your total planned
spending/revenue for this financial metric in 2030.
Percentage share of financial metric that is taxonomy-eligible in the reporting year (column 10)
• This column appears only if “Yes” is selected in column 3 “Indicate whether you are also
reporting eligibility information for the selected objective”.
• Organizations disclosing alignment against the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities
should use this column to enter their spending/revenue that is assessed to be eligible
under the EU Taxonomy. This figure should include the spending/revenue that is
assessed to be aligned.
Percentage share of financial metric that is taxonomy non-eligible in the reporting year (column
11)
• This column appears only if “Yes” is selected in column 3 “Indicate whether you are also
reporting eligibility information for the selected objective”.
• Organizations disclosing alignment against the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities
should use this column to enter their spending/revenue that is assessed to be non-eligible
under the EU Taxonomy.
Page 259 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

Details of the methodology or framework used to assess alignment with your organization’s
climate transition (column 12)
• Provide the criteria used to determine the alignment of the spending/revenue with your
organization’s climate transition, including:
o Examples of the activities, assets, technologies, products and/or services
for which you classified the associated spending/revenue as aligned with
your organization’s climate transition, as per your chosen methodology.
o Examples of activities, assets, technologies, products and/or services for
which you did not classify the associated spending/revenue as aligned.
• Comment on how your organization’s spending/revenue that is aligned with your climate
transition is estimated to change over time and describe the assumptions underlying the
estimation.
• Organizations that selected “Other, please specify” in column 1 “Methodology or
framework used to assess alignment” should indicate whether you have obtained third
party verification/assurance for your alignment information.
• Organizations disclosing alignment against the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities
should use this column to describe your methodology for calculating your taxonomy
alignment and eligibility and how you have avoided double-counting. If you have obtained
third party verification/assurance for your alignment information, you will have the
opportunity to indicate this in a subsequent question.

Aquaculture constitutes a big part of our activities in Sweden. Given the lack of coverage of the agricultural sector under the EU
Taxonomy, we have assessed the CAPEX associated with these activities using a bespoke methodology based on a
combination of technical criteria established by the Aquaculture Act of Sweden and the principle of do no significant harm of the
EU Taxonomy Regulation. As part of our net-zero by 2045 commitment, we intend to halve our footprint from fish feed and air
freight. We are planning to increase the CAPEX associated with sustainable feedstock and special packaging to increase shelf
life of our products from 5% to 10% of our total CAPEX by 2030.
We have assessed the alignment of our power generation activity from the onshore wind farm under the EU Taxonomy. The 8%
figure disclosed represents the proportion of our total CAPEX associated with the substantial contribution of our onshore wind
power generation activity to climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation in the reporting year. CAPEX associated
with our onshore wind power plants, plant machinery and grid equipment are included. As part of our net-zero commitment to
triple our renewable energy assets by 2045, we plan to increase our taxonomy-aligned CAPEX to 20% in 2025 and 40% in 2030.
In calculating the figure as a total across both climate-related objectives, we followed the EU Commission’s guidance to avoid
double counting by separately counting CAPEX associated with activities contributing to climate mitigation and climate
adaptation at the activity level.

20 35 50 50 Our company’s operations include clinker and
cement manufacturing activities which are
eligible under the EU Taxonomy. In the reporting
year, 15% of our total turnover was attributable
to the manufacture of grey cement clinker and
cement from alternative hydraulic binder –
activities which met all criteria to contribute
substantially to climate change mitigation under
the EU Taxonomy by enabling the transition to
1.5C. Our operations in these activities are
expected to expand by 2030 as we phase out
our conventional cement manufacturing units.
Therefore, we expect the proportion of our total
turnover which substantially contributes to
climate change mitigation under the taxonomy to
increase to 35% by 2030. We also hope to
report to an increased alignment of our activities
in manufacturing of diisocyanates (currently not
covered under the EU Taxonomy) with an
expansion of technical screening criteria for
activities in this sector under the EU Taxonomy.

Requested content General
• This question requests information on the numerical amount and percentage of your
organization’s total turnover, CAPEX, and, where applicable, OPEX in the reporting year
which, in relation to a selected activity, is:
o Taxonomy-aligned: meets the criteria prescribed under a sustainable finance
taxonomy;
o Taxonomy-eligible but not aligned: does not meet the criteria prescribed
under a sustainable finance taxonomy;
• Note that the information provided in this question should be limited to activities which are
eligible (or aligned) under a sustainable finance taxonomy (i.e., activities which are
eligible to be classified as environmentally sustainable under the taxonomy).
• If you are disclosing information under the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities, you
should report each of Revenue/Turnover, CAPEX, and, where applicable, OPEX for your
selected activities.
• If you have obtained third party verification/assurance for your taxonomy-alignment data,
you will have the opportunity to indicate this in 5.4.3 and 13.1.
• See “Explanation of terms” for more information.
Economic activity (column 1)
• Select the option that best describes the activity for which you are disclosing financial
information on taxonomy-eligibility or -alignment.
• The list of economic activities corresponds to the classification of environmentally
sustainable economic activities included within the Climate Delegated Act to the EU
Taxonomy Regulation. Organizations reporting against taxonomies other than the EU
Taxonomy should select the closest approximation of the activity for which you wish to
report information, based on their given description within the Climate Delegated Act.
Whilst the EU Taxonomy list of activities are largely based on the Nomenclature of
Economic Activities (NACE), note that these references are only indicative and not
exhaustive. Therefore, even in the absence of a NACE sector reference in the Climate
Delegated Act, an economic activity that you wish to report on may yet match the activity
description laid out by the Act and be eligible for reporting.
• If an activity comprises elements that are both taxonomy-aligned and taxonomy-eligible
but not aligned (e.g., the activity meets the criteria prescribed under the taxonomy for
Page 267 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

some of your organization’s facilities but not others), add two separate rows for that
activity. In one row, provide financial information for the proportion that is taxonomy-
aligned, and in the other, provide financial information for the proportion that is taxonomy-
eligible but not aligned. Select the relevant option in column 3 to indicate which type of
taxonomy alignment you are reporting for each row.
• Organizations disclosing information under the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities
may also report eligibility figures for each financial metric if their activities correspond to
any of the 12 new activities added following a 2023 amendment to the Climate Delegated
Act.
Taxonomy under which information is being reported (column 2)
• If you wish to provide financial information on your organization’s alignment with an
activity-level sustainable finance taxonomy that is not listed, select “Other, please specify”
and provide the name of the taxonomy.
Taxonomy Alignment (column 3)
• Select “Taxonomy-aligned" to report financial information for an activity (or a proportion of
an activity) which meets the criteria prescribed under the sustainable finance taxonomy
selected in column 2 in the reporting year.
• Select “Taxonomy-eligible but not aligned” to report financial information for an activity (or
a proportion of an activity) which does not meet the criteria prescribed under the
sustainable finance taxonomy selected in column 2 in the reporting year.
• If you are disclosing information under the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities,
selecting “Taxonomy-aligned” in this column indicates that you are able to provide
information in columns 28-31 of this question and column 1 of 5.4.2 as per the
requirements of Article 3 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.
• “Taxonomy-eligible, alignment not assessed” will only appear if you are disclosing
information under the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities and have selected one of
the 12 newly added activities in column 1 (refer to Annex I of the 2023 amendment to the
Climate Delegated Act for the list of newly added activities). If you wish to disclose
information for any of the new activities, you will only have the option to report eligibility
figures. Please add rows to report your eligibility figures per financial metric for each
activity separately.
• Your selection in this column will drive the appearance of subsequent columns.
Financial metrics (column 4)
• Select the financial metrics you would like to provide information for.
• If you are disclosing information under the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities, you
should select turnover, CAPEX, and, if relevant, OPEX for each row reported, i.e., for
each taxonomy-aligned activity (or proportion of an activity) and each taxonomy-eligible
but not aligned activity (or proportion of an activity).
• Your selections in this column will drive the appearance of subsequent columns.
Types of substantial contribution (column 5)
• This column is presented if “Taxonomy-aligned” is selected in column 3 “Taxonomy
alignment”.
• Select the types of substantial contribution to climate change mitigation and/or climate
change adaptation you are disclosing for the activity selected in column 1:
o Own performance: the activity is being performed in a way that it itself
contributes substantially by making a positive impact or removing a negative
impact on climate change mitigation. For example, where the activity is already
low-carbon. If you are disclosing alignment against the EU Taxonomy for
Sustainable Activities, note that activities are considered substantially
contributing through own performance if they meet the corresponding technical
screening criteria established by the Climate Delegated Act (Annex I- pg. 12-
140).
Page 268 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

o Adapted activity: the activity is being performed in a way that it itself
contributes substantially by making a positive impact or removing a negative
impact on climate change adaptation. For example, where the activity adopts
adaptation solutions. If you are disclosing alignment against the EU Taxonomy
for Sustainable Activities, note that activities may qualify as substantially
contributing through own performance if they meet the corresponding technical
screening criteria established by the Climate Delegated Act (Annex II- pg. 146-
346).
o Transitional activity: the activity does not have a technologically or
economically feasible low-carbon alternative, but substantially contributes to
climate change mitigation by supporting the transition to a net-zero carbon
economy consistent with a pathway to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C
above preindustrial levels.
o Activity enabling climate change mitigation: the activity enables a
substantial contribution to be made to climate change mitigation in other
activities. For example, the activity enables other activities to achieve emissions
reductions.
o Activity enabling climate change adaptation: the activity enables a
substantial contribution to be made to climate change adaptation in other
activities. For example, the activity is developing adaptation solutions.
• If you are disclosing against the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities, you are
encouraged to use the EU Taxonomy Compass tool developed by the EU Commission,
to determine whether an activity is enabling or transitional.
• If the activity substantially contributes to both climate change mitigation and climate
change adaptation, select all types of substantial contribution across both objectives. For
example, an activity may contribute substantially to climate change mitigation based on
its own performance, and also enable climate change adaptation.

Our company specialises in meter installation and servicing for businesses and households. We began N/A
assessing the eligibility of our revenue and spending with the EU Taxonomy this year due to the recent inclusion
of activities relevant to our business under the Taxonomy Regulation. In our assessment, we considered CAPEX
associated with our electric and gas meter installation which includes the cost of equipment and assembly,
amounting to 35% of our total capital expenditure. We have also accounted for costs associated with our
servicing operations which extend to maintenance, repair and meter conversions, amounting to 20% of our total
capital expenditure.
With smart meter installation and conversion from analogue to digital meters as our special focus, we expect in
future to report taxonomy alignment through substantial contribution to climate change mitigation by own
performance as well as by enabling mitigation.
By 2025, we expect close to 20% of our CAPEX associated with our smart meter technology designed to
increase energy efficiency of low voltage installations, to be aligned with the taxonomy. We are also currently
scoping out the expansion of our business to distribute software enabling grid simulation to improve
performance, which we believe, will increase the proportion of our taxonomy aligned turnover, CAPEX and
OPEX.

operating expenditure (OPEX) for the reporting year, and the anticipated trend for the next reporting
year?
Question details
Change from last No change (2023 W7.2)
year
Rationale Within a company, this information raises the strategic understanding of the value of water for
the business (beyond the price paid for it).
Signalling the direction of travel of capital expenditure and operating expenditure to CDP data
users helps them understand their potential exposure.
The question asks for a reporting of trends and not absolute values. It identifies changes in
water-related investment and operational costs. The information provided here should align
with the information provided on risk response strategies and business opportunities (reported
in 3.1 and 3.6).

Pricing Environmental Externalities
Section overview
Section Internal pricing of environmental externalities has emerged as a useful tool that supports
Overview organizations in assessing environmental risks and opportunities. The environmental effects of
production and consumption are often not reflected in market prices. By introducing an internal
price on environmental externalities, organizations aim to internalize the true cost of production
and consumption. For example, an organization may incorporate internal carbon or water pricing
mechanisms into financial plans and budgets, ensuring accountability for carbon emissions and
water consumption.
Data users are keen to understand how organizations attribute a monetary value to
environmental risks and opportunities. For further guidance on reporting to the questions in this
section see CDP’s Technical Note Carbon Pricing: CDP Disclosure Best Practice.
(5.10) Does your organization use an internal price on environmental externalities?
Question details
Change from last Modified question for Climate change and Water (2023 C11.3, W7.4)
year
Rationale Internal pricing of environmental externalities (i.e., a carbon price or water price) has emerged
as a multifaceted tool that supports organizations in assessing environmental risks and
opportunities. Data users are keen to understand how organizations attribute a monetary value
to these risks and translate them into a uniform metric. Applying an internal price to these
externalities can help an organization to understand opportunities for efficiencies and prepare
for potential future price changes.
Ambition • The organization applies internal environmental pricing schemes to incentivize the
consideration of environmental issues in risk assessment and decision making, and in the
implementation of its environmental policies and targets.

(5.10.1) Provide details of your organization’s internal price on carbon.
Question details
Question The question only appears if you select “Carbon” in response to column 2 “Environmental
dependencies externality priced” of 5.10
Change from last Modified question (2023 C11.3a)
year
Rationale An internal price on an environmental externality (e.g., a carbon price) can be used as a tool to
manage environmental risks and opportunities within an organization’s operations, value chain,
and investments. As part of their assessment of an organization’s resilience, it is useful for
data users to know how organizations are using an internal price on carbon. This information
allows data users to assess how effectively an organization implements its internal carbon
price to achieve its environmental objectives.
Ambition • The organization applies internal environmental pricing to incentivize the consideration
of environmental issues in risk assessment and decision making, and in the
implementation of its environmental policies and targets.
• The organization discloses the internal price in units of the organization’s reporting
currency per metric ton CO2e.
• The organization discloses the type of internal carbon pricing scheme used (e.g., a
shadow price) and the scope of the application of the scheme (e.g., activities,
geographies). It discloses any assumptions made to determine the price and the
calculation methodology used.
• The organization monitors and evaluates the internal carbon pricing approach and
discloses whether and how it expects its internal carbon price to change over time, and
the reasons for any expected change.
• The organization applies one or more carbon prices to all GHG emission scopes and
discloses whether the same price is applied to all scopes, and the reason for using a
different price per scope if a different price is used.
• The organization discloses the percentage of total GHG emissions in the relevant
scopes the carbon pricing scheme covers, as consistent with their GHG inventory.
• The organization sets their carbon price using scientific guidance and aligns it to
science-based carbon pricing trajectories.

Requested content General
• If your organization uses more than one type of internal carbon price, add a row to
provide details for each type.
Type of internal carbon price (column 1)
• Shadow price: where a hypothetical cost of carbon is attached to each ton of CO2e to
reveal hidden risks and opportunities throughout the organization’s operations and value
chain and to support strategic decision-making related to future capital investments. A
shadow price can be used in investment decisions or to set budgets, but no actual
financial flows are generated.
• Internal fee: mechanisms which charge responsible internal business units for their
GHG emissions. An internal fee mechanism approach results in actual financial flows as
the collected revenue is reinvested back into clean technologies and other activities that
help transition the entire organization towards lower-carbon operations and investments.
• Implicit price: where the cost of emissions abatement is divided by the tons of CO2e
abated. An implicit price is calculated retroactively, after the organization achieves its
desired emissions reductions. This calculation helps quantify the capital investments
required to meet climate-related targets and is frequently used as a benchmark for
implementing a more strategic internal carbon price. Some organizations may also
internalize the cost of purchasing carbon credits to set an implicit carbon price.
• Internal trading: mechanisms which allow internal business units to trade allocated
carbon credits.
Objectives for implementing internal price (column 2)
• Select your organization’s objectives for implementing the internal carbon price. In many
cases, organizations report multiple objectives – particularly as developments occur that
require a readjustment of their pricing approach to maximize its effectiveness.
• The available options reflect the most common objectives that organizations disclose to
CDP; this list is not exhaustive, and you can specify other objectives by selecting “Other,
please specify.”
Factors considered when determining the price (column 3)
• Select all the factors that best reflect what you consider when determining the price.
• For example, you may use the current or future projected price of allowances under an
Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and scenario analysis to determine the level of your
shadow price or internal fee. In this case, select both dropdown options.
Calculation methodology and assumptions made in determining the price (column 4)
• Provide further details on the calculation methodology used to determine the price.
• If you made any assumptions when determining the price, provide details of the
assumptions here.
Scopes covered (column 5)
• Identify the scopes of emissions covered by the internal carbon pricing mechanism. An
effective internal carbon price is one that incentivizes an organization to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions throughout their value chain and to integrate low-carbon
activities into their operations.
• It is best practice for organizations to consider their impact beyond just scope 1 and 2
emissions to address risks and opportunities associated with their scope 3 emissions as
well, such as in-sourcing and procurement decisions and R&D decisions regarding
innovation in the market.
Page 306 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

Pricing approach used – spatial variance (column 6)
• Select the pricing approach which reflects how the actual price varies across the
organization.
o Uniform pricing: a single carbon price that is applied throughout the
organization independent of geography, business unit or type of decision.
o Differentiated pricing: a carbon price that varies by region, business unit, or
type of decision.
Indicate how and why the price is differentiated (column 7)
• This column only appears if you select “Differentiated pricing” in column 6 “Pricing
approach used – spatial variance”.
• Indicate how and why your price varies spatially.
Pricing approach used – temporal variance (column 8)
• Select the pricing approach which reflects how the actual price will develop over time:
o Static pricing: a price that is constant over time.
o Evolutionary pricing: a price that develops over time.
Indicate how you expect the price to change over time (column 9)
• This column only appears if you select “Evolutionary” in column 8 “Pricing approach used
– temporal variance”.
• Indicate how you expect the actual price of your evolutionary carbon price to change over
time. Aim to be specific and quantitative in your response by disclosing the expected
percent increase over a specified timeframe.
Actual price used – minimum/maximum (currency per metric ton CO2e) (columns 10 and 11)
• If you are reporting a uniform carbon price, you should enter the same figure for the
associated minimum and maximum price.
• These figures should be in the same currency that you selected in 1.2 for all financial
information disclosed throughout your response.
• If you are reporting a differentiated price, you should enter the minimum actual price
applied within your organization in column 10 “Minimum actual price used (currency per
metric ton CO2e)”, and the maximum price applied within your organization in column 11
“Maximum actual price used (currency per metric ton CO2e)”.
• As a guide to determining the actual price, note that the Carbon Pricing Leadership
Coalition concluded that a price of US$50-100/tC02 by 2030 is required to achieve the
Paris temperature target (Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition, 2017).
Business decision-making processes the internal carbon price is applied to (column 12)
• Select all the business decision-making processes that the internal carbon pricing
mechanism applies to.
• For example, if your organization has set an internal carbon price to drive low-carbon
investments, the internal carbon price may be used to inform decision-making processes
around research and development of new products/services, procurement, and/or capital
expenditure.
Internal price is mandatory within business decision-making processes (column 13)
• The degree to which an internal carbon price is enforced in the business decision-making
process will vary by organization.
• Indicate whether your organization enforces the use of the price within the business
decision making processes as a mandatory measure.
• If you select “Yes, for some decision-making processes, please specify”, specify the
business decision making processes selected in column 12 “Business decision-making
processes the internal carbon price is applied to” to which the internal carbon price is
enforced as mandatory.
% total emissions in the reporting year in selected scopes this internal price covers (column 14)
• Provide the proportion of the total emissions in the reporting year that the internal carbon
price covered for the scopes selected in column 5 “Scope covered”.
Page 307 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

• It will be assumed that your total emissions are as per the figures reported in Module 7 of
this CDP disclosure.
Pricing approach is monitored and evaluated to achieve objectives (column 15)
• To ensure a carbon price is an effective tool in achieving the organization’s
environmental commitments, an organization should monitor and evaluate the pricing
approach. Specify if this process has been established.
• The objectives refer to the objectives outlined in column 1 “Objectives for implementing
internal price”.
Details of how the pricing approach is monitored and evaluated to achieve your objectives
(column 16)
• Detail the process for monitoring and evaluating the carbon price, including frequency,
tools, and methods used.
• Explain how the internal carbon price has contributed to the implementation of your
organization’s commitments through its application in key business decision-making
processes (as selected in column 12 “Business decision-making processes the internal
carbon price is applied to”) and/or the achievement of the original objectives (as selected
in column 1 “Objectives for implementing internal price”).
• If relevant, explain how the internal carbon price has contributed to the implementation of
your organization’s climate transition plan.
• Provide regional, sectoral, and/or operational context to your response.
• If the internal carbon price has not impacted your business in any way, explain why, and
specify if there are any specific challenges associated with your current mechanism.

Change from last Modified question (2023 W7.4)
year
Rationale The true value of water is not accounted for in today’s markets in many parts of the world,
while the costs of treatment and delivery, as well as opportunity costs and environmental and
social costs, are not well captured. As water becomes increasingly scarce and contested,
businesses could see prices increase. Applying an internal price on water that more accurately
reflects the costs of the organization’s water provision can help it understand opportunities for
efficiencies and prepare for potential future price changes.
As part of their assessment of an organization’s resilience, it is useful for data users to know if
organizations are using an internal price on water. This information allows data users to assess
how effectively an organization implements its internal water price to achieve its environmental
objectives.
Ambition • The organization applies internal environmental pricing schemes to incentivize the
consideration of environmental issues in risk assessment and decision making, and in
the implementation of its environmental policies and targets.
• The organization discloses the internal price in units of the organization’s reporting
currency per megaliter of water.
• The organization discloses the type of internal water pricing scheme used (e.g., a
shadow price) and the scope of the application of the scheme (e.g., activities,

• If your organization uses more than one type of internal water price, add a row to provide
details for each type.
Type of pricing scheme (column 1)
• Shadow price: where a hypothetical cost is attached to water usage (per cubic meter) to
reveal hidden risks and opportunities throughout the organization’s operations and value
chain and to support strategic decision-making related to future capital investments. A
shadow price can be used in investment decisions or to set budgets, but no actual
financial flows are generated.
• Internal fee: mechanisms which charge responsible internal business units for their
water impacts (including consumption and discharges). An internal fee mechanism
approach results in actual financial flows as the collected revenue is reinvested back into
technological advancement and other activities that help the organization achieve its
environmental targets.
• Implicit price: dividing the cost of water abatement/treatment by the corresponding
quantity used in cubic meters. An implicit price is calculated retroactively, after an
organization achieves its desired environmental reductions. This calculation helps
quantify the capital investments required to meet environment-related targets and is
frequently used as a benchmark for implementing a more strategic internal price on
externalities. This metric can be used as a benchmark for establishing a strategic internal
pricing mechanism for water.
• Internal trading: mechanisms which allow internal business units to trade allocated
credits for water usage.
Page 310 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

Objectives for implementing internal price (column 2)
• Select your organization’s objectives for implementing the internal water price. In many
cases, companies report multiple objectives – particularly as developments occur that
require a readjustment of their pricing approach to maximize its effectiveness.
• The available options reflect the most common objectives that organizations disclose to
CDP; this list is not exhaustive, and you can specify other objectives by selecting “Other,
please specify.”
Factors beyond the current market price are considered in the price (column 3)
• Select the option that best reflects whether you consider factors other than market price
when setting a price.
• The market price of water is the current price at which water can be bought or sold. This
price is typically set by external suppliers but may include other direct costs of supply.
The market price may be influenced by government policy such as subsidies, taxation, or
regulation. Examples of factors beyond market price that you may consider when setting
your internal water price are water conservation, cost of achieving environmental targets,
social effects of environmental impacts, or strategic considerations.
Factors considered when determining the price (column 4)
• This column only appears if you select “Yes” in column 3 “Factors beyond the market
price are considered in the price”.
• Select all the factors that best reflect what you consider when determining the actual
price of the internal water price.
• For example, you may use scenario analysis to calculate the future projected price of
water tariffs. This may determine the level of your shadow price or internal fee. In this
case, select both dropdown options.
Calculation methodology and assumptions made in determining the price (column 5)
• This column only appears if you select “Yes” in column 3 “Factors beyond the market
price are considered in the price”.
• Provide further details on the calculation methodology used to determine the price.
• If you made any assumptions when determining the price, you may provide details of
these here.
Stages of the value chain covered (column 6)
• This column only appears if you select “Yes” in column 3 “Factors beyond the market
price are considered in the price”.
• Select the stages of the value chain covered by the internal water pricing mechanism. An
effective internal water price is one that incentivizes an organization to reduce water
impacts throughout their value chain and to integrate efficiencies into their operations.
• It is best practice for organizations to consider their impact beyond just direct operations
to address risks and opportunities associated with their upstream and downstream value
chain as well, such as procurement decisions and R&D decisions regarding innovation in
the market.
Pricing approach used – spatial variance (column 7)
• This column only appears if you select “Yes” in column 3 “Factors beyond the market
price are considered in the price”.
• Select the pricing approach which reflects how the actual price varies across the
organization.

Value chain engagement
Section overview
Section In order to reduce environmental impact globally, organizations must engage with their value
Overview chain (both upstream and downstream). Questions within this section examine how organizations
are working and engaging with their suppliers, customers, stakeholders, and other partners. This
section provides data users with insight into the different types of requirements and engagement
techniques organizations use to engage with their value chain on environmental issues.
(5.11) Do you engage with your value chain on environmental issues?
Question details
Question dependencies Your response to this question will determine which subsequent questions and
response options within subsequent questions are presented. If your response to
5.11 is amended, data in those dependent questions may be erased.
Change from last year New question for Plastics
Modified question for Climate change, Forests, and Water (2023 C12.1, C12.1e, F6.7,
F6.8, F6.9, W1.5)
Rationale Engaging with value chain stakeholders is essential for organizations to drive progress
on environmental issues associated with their operations. There are multiple
drivers, benefits, and ranges of engagement relating to each environmental issue,
from environmental requirements for suppliers to innovative partnerships for
environmental stewardship with product users. If you are not engaging with your
value chain on environmental issues, data users wish to know why you are not
engaging in any way and what your plans are to do so in the future.
Ambition • The organization has a value chain engagement strategy for environmental issues
and undertakes value chain engagement to positively affect its value chain
stakeholders and the environment.

where the effect of environmental dependencies
and impacts is greatest. This question allows data
users to understand whether an organization is
aware of where environmental dependencies
and/or impacts exist in its upstream value chain.
Ambition • The organization assesses its suppliers
according to their dependencies and/or impacts
on the environment and identifies those with
substantive dependencies and/or impacts.
• The organization discloses the percentage of
suppliers identified with substantive

• General
content
This question focuses on tier 1 (direct) suppliers only.
•
• % tier 1 suppliers assessed (column 3)
Out of your total tier 1 suppliers, specify the percentage for which you have assessed their
dependencies and/or impacts on the environment based on the criteria specified in column 2
“Criteria for assessing supplier dependencies and/or impacts on the environment”.
• For example, if you have 1000 tier 1 suppliers, and you assessed half of them based on
the criteria selected in column 2 “Criteria for assessing supplier dependencies and/or
impacts on the environment”, select “26-50%” here.
Define thresholds for classifying suppliers as having substantive dependencies and/or impacts
on the environment using selected criteria (column 4)
• For each criterion selected in column 2 “Criteria for assessing supplier dependencies
and/or impacts on the environment”, describe the threshold used to assess the
dependency and/or impact of your suppliers on the environment. The threshold
represents the organization-specific level above which a supplier is considered to have
substantive dependency or impact, reflecting the criteria set by your organization.
• For example:
o If “Dependence on commodities” was selected as the criterion in column 2
“Criteria for assessing supplier dependencies and/or impacts on the
environment”, elaborate on how this criterion was used to classify suppliers as
having substantive dependencies in your context. For instance, you may
classify suppliers as having substantive dependencies if they are dependent on
a specific ingredient that is critical to your final product.
o If “Basin/landscape condition” was selected as the criterion in column 2
“Criteria for assessing supplier dependencies and/or impacts on the
environment”, elaborate on how you classified suppliers as having substantive
dependencies and/or impacts using basin condition. For instance, indicate
whether you utilized the CEO Water Mandate’s “100 Priority Basins ” list to
assess supplier locations and prioritize engagement with suppliers situated in
one of these priority basins.
• If your threshold is based on multiple criteria selected in column 2 “Criteria for
assessing supplier dependencies and/or impacts on the environment”, specify the
threshold for each criterion selected. The cumulative outcome of these thresholds
should be used to determine the percentage and number of tier 1 suppliers in the
following columns.
% tier 1 suppliers meeting the thresholds for substantive dependencies and/or impacts on the
environment (column 5)
• Out of the tier 1 suppliers assessed for the criteria selected in column 2 “Criteria for
assessing supplier dependencies and/or impacts on the environment”, provide the
percentage of suppliers identified to have substantive dependencies and/or impacts on
the environment, as per the thresholds defined in column 4 “Define a threshold for
Page 318 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

suppliers with substantive dependencies and/or impacts on the environment”. For
example, if you assessed half of your tier 1 suppliers and half of those assessed met
the thresholds, select “26-50%” here.
Number of tier 1 suppliers meeting the thresholds for substantive dependencies and/or impacts
on the environment (column 6)
• Enter the number of tier 1 suppliers assessed and identified to have substantive
dependencies and/or impacts on the environment, as per the thresholds defined in
column 4 “Define a threshold for suppliers with substantive dependencies and/or
impacts on the environment”.
• This number should be calculated by multiplying the percentage provided in column 5
“% tier 1 suppliers meeting the thresholds for substantive dependencies and/or impacts
on the environment” by the number of tier 1 suppliers assessed for the criteria selected
in column 2 “Criteria for assessing supplier dependencies and/or impacts on the
environment”. For example, if you assessed half of your 1000 tier 1 suppliers and half
of those assessed met the thresholds, enter 250 here.

Explain how and why clients were chosen for the engagement selected in column 3a “Type of
engagement”, e.g., exposure to environmental risks and/or opportunities, potential impact on
climate change/forests/water, proportion of revenue generated, geographic location, etc.
Client engagement can be either untargeted (undertaken generally with all clients or
undertaken with a selection of clients without a basis for the selection) or targeted at specific
clients, such as clients in a particular sector with increased environmental risks relative to other
sectors. There is a place for both, but targeted engagement may be more effective at driving
change in the real economy.
Describe how you communicate your engagement strategy to your clients and/or to the public
(column 7)
Briefly describe the process you have for communicating your engagement strategy, including
whether it is publicly available, whether you communicate progress and outcomes of
engagements with clients and/or the public, and if so, how.
Roles of individuals at the portfolio organizations you seek to engage with (column 10)
Select all options which represent the roles in the portfolio organization you aim to engage with
as part of your environmental engagement strategy.
Effect of engagement, including measures of success (column 11)
• Discuss the effect of the engagement and how you measure its success.
• Include a threshold at which you consider your effect to be successful with regard to the
measure of success. For example, if you select “Provide training, support, and best
practices on how to set science-based targets,” the measure of success could be a 10%
increase in clients obtaining validation of their emissions reduction targets by the Science
Based Targets initiative (SBTi).
• Define the coverage of your portfolio based on the portfolio value represented by clients
participating in this engagement activity.
• Include a description of any engagement activity you undertake with clients to manage
environmental risks in your portfolio.
• Provide examples of positive outcomes achieved. For example, this could include clients
reducing GHG emissions in their direct operations or increasing renewable energy
procurement.
• The description should be organization-specific and include details on the impact of the
environmental engagement strategy with your clients.

This question focuses on corporate investees only.
% of scope 3 emissions as reported in 12.1.1 (column 3)
This column only appears if “Climate change” is selected in column 1 “Environmental issues
covered by the engagement strategy”.
Only include the percentage of investee-related scope 3 emissions reported in 12.1.1 that are
attributable to investees participating in the activity selected in this row.
% of investing (Asset managers) portfolio covered in relation to total portfolio value (column 4)
Provide the proportion your portfolio covered by the engagement process/strategy based on the
total portfolio value, as reported in question 1.10.
% of investing (Asset owners) portfolio covered in relation to total portfolio value (column 5)
Provide the proportion of your portfolio covered by the engagement strategy based on the total
portfolio value, as reported in question 1.10.
Explain the rationale for the coverage of your engagement (column 6)
Explain how and why investees were chosen for the engagement selected in column 2a “Type
of engagement”, e.g., proportion of revenue generated, geographic location, etc.
Investee engagement can be either untargeted (undertaken generally with all investees or
undertaken with a selection of investees without a basis for the selection) or targeted at specific
investees, such as investees in a particular sector with increased environmental risks relative to
other sectors. There is a place for both, but targeted engagement may be more effective at
driving change in the real economy.
Describe how you communicate your engagement strategy to your clients and/or to the public
(column 7)
Page 328 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

Briefly describe the process you have for communicating your engagement strategy, including
whether it is publicly available, whether you communicate progress and outcomes of
engagements with investees or the public and, if so, how.
Roles of individuals at the portfolio organizations the entity seeks to engage with (column 10)
Select all options which represent the roles in the portfolio organizations you aim to engage
with as part of your environmental engagement strategy.
Effect of engagement, including measures of success (column 11)
Discuss the impact of this engagement and how you measure its success.
Include a threshold at which you consider your effect to be successful with regard to the
measure of success. For example, if you select “Provide training, support, and best practices
on how to set science-based targets,” the measure of success could be a 10% increase in
clients obtaining validation of their emissions reduction targets by the Science Based Targets
initiative (SBTi).
Define the coverage of your investment portfolio based on the portfolio value represented by
investees participating in this engagement activity.
Include a description of any engagement activity you undertake with investee organizations to
manage environmental risks in your investment portfolio.
Provide examples of positive outcomes achieved. For example, this could include investees
reducing product use-phase GHG emissions or increasing renewable energy procurement.
The description should be organization-specific and include details on the impact of the
environmental investee engagement strategy.
Describe your escalation process (column 13)
This column only appears if “Yes, we have an escalation process” is selected in column 12
“Escalation process for engagement when dialogue is failing”.
Describe the tactics included in your escalation process e.g., how you express concerns,
making public statements, expressing concerns collectively with other investors or
shareholders, speaking at general meetings, exit or threat to exit from the investment and
others.

Environmental Issue Question level CC, F, W
(Theme)
Sector Question level FS only
(5.11.5) Do your suppliers have to meet environmental requirements as part of your organization’s
purchasing process?
Question details
Question This question only appears if you select “Yes” in response to column 1 “Engaging with this
dependencies stakeholder on environmental issues” for the row “Suppliers” of 5.11.
Change from last year New question for Forests
Modified question for Climate change and Water (2023 C12.2, W1.5b)
Rationale Setting environmental requirements for suppliers is a manifestation of strategic
commitment to environmental action that not only enhances organizations’ awareness
of environmental concerns but also serves as a powerful catalyst for driving
Page 329 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

transformative action throughout the upstream value chain. By setting stringent
environmental requirements for suppliers, organizations assert their dedication to
proactive change, fostering a culture of responsibility that resonates throughout value
chains and industries, and paves the way for a more sustainable future.
Ambition • The organization has environmental requirements that all relevant suppliers have
to meet as part of their purchasing process. These are included in supplier
contracts and the organization has mechanisms for monitoring compliance with
these requirements.
• The organization has clear, consistent, and documented policies and procedures
for addressing supplier non-compliance. The organization should, where possible,
retain non-compliant suppliers and promote compliance before suspending or
excluding the supplier.

Organizations responding to either of the “Yes…” options in any row will be further prompted to
identify the environmental requirements and provide details of the compliance measures in
place in the following question.
Page 330 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

Suppliers have to meet specific environmental requirements related to this environmental
issue as part of the purchasing process (column 1)
Select “Yes, environmental requirements related to this environmental issue are included in our
supplier contracts” if your suppliers are obliged, as outlined in their contract with your
organization, to adhere to specific environmental requirements set by your organization related
to the environmental issue in column 0 “Environmental issue”.

issue, but they are not included in our supplier contracts” if your suppliers have to meet
environmental requirements related to the environmental issue in column 0 “Environmental
issue” as part of your organization’s purchasing process, but the requirements are not formally
written as a contractual obligation. For example, your organization may have a non-contractual
supplier code of conduct featuring environmental requirements or environmental requirements
may be included in your organization’s supplier selection process.
Policy in place for addressing supplier non-compliance (column 2)
Select “Yes, we have a policy in place for addressing non-compliance"’ if you have an
established policy to manage suppliers who do not adhere to the environmental requirements

(5.11.7) Provide further details of your organization’s supplier engagement on environmental
issues.
Question details
Question dependencies This question only appears if you select “Yes” in
response to column 1 “Engaging with this stakeholder
on environmental issues” for the row “Suppliers” of 5.11.
Change from last year New question for Plastics
Modified question for Climate change, Forests and
Water (2023 C12.1a, F6.8, F6.9, W1.5d)
Rationale Proactive supplier engagement on environmental
initiatives showcases an organization’s
commitment to driving environmental action. This
question facilitates data users’ evaluation of an
organization’s sustainability efforts in their value
chain, by revealing how comprehensive their
understanding is of environmental issues
throughout their upstream value chain. This
comprehensive awareness allows organizations to
manage environmental issues holistically,
benefiting from a more thorough understanding of
dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities
within their upstream value chain.
Ambition The organization sets quantitative measures of success
to evaluate the effect of its engagement.
The organization has practices in place to support
vulnerable suppliers.
• The organization discloses the percentage of
suppliers identified with substantive dependencies
and/or impacts, with whom it actively engages on
environmental issues.
• For organizations purchasing commodity volumes
where there is a risk of deforestation and
conversion of other natural ecosystems,
organizations should manage their entire value
chains to ensure volume-level DCF (deforestation-
and conversion-free) compliance and obtain third
party verification. Where relevant, organizations
should engage with suppliers to commit to and
achieve DCF compliance across their suppliers’
entire business.

Section This section asks organizations in the financial services sector to disclose how aligned their
Overview shareholders’ voting on their investment portfolios is with the organization’s overall environmental
strategy. In addition, this section requests organizations to demonstrate how they support
introducing environmental shareholder resolutions into their business strategy and investment
portfolios.

Change from last year Modified question (C-FS12.2, FW-FS4.2)
Rationale Active ownership is a key tool for positively affecting the real economy because
divestment alone leaves investors without a voice to promote sustainable
practices. Alongside their investee engagement activities, investors can

voting rights. Data users are interested in understanding how aligned
shareholders’ voting decisions across the investment portfolio are with the
overall environmental strategy and how they support environmental shareholder
resolutions.

the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) and the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming
of 1.5°C (SR1.5).
• Alignment with the goals of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework:
refers to the four long-term goals for 2050 (CBD, 2023), including the goal to ensure that
the integrity, connectivity and resilience of all ecosystems are maintained, enhanced, or
restored, substantially increasing the area of natural ecosystems by 2050. When evaluating
alignment with the Global Biodiversity Framework, it is particularly important to consider

Module 6: Environmental Performance – Consolidation
Approach
Guidance for companies reporting on Climate change, Forests, Water Security, Plastics, Biodiversity on
behalf of investors & supply chain members.
The full reporting guidance including explanation of terms is available via the portal/public guidance page.
Definition of time horizons
(6.1) Provide details on your chosen consolidation approach for the calculation of environmental
performance data.
Question details
Change from last Modified question (2023 C0.5, F0.5, F-MM0.9/F-CO0.9, W0.5)
year
Rationale The consolidation approach is the method by which environmental impacts (e.g., GHG
emissions, water withdrawals etc.) have been attributed to your organization. This
context will help data users interpret how the environmental impacts relate to your
business operations.
Ambition • The organization discloses whether the consolidation of their entities in the
accounting of their environmental impacts has been done through the financial
control approach, operational control approach, equity share approach, or
another method. The organization provides an explanation for why the
particular method was chosen.

Requested content General
• The “consolidation approach” identifies which entities are included within the
calculation of your environmental performance data and determines the
information that is relevant for your organization to disclose within Modules 7-12.
Page 366 of 368 @cdp | www.cdp.net @cdp | www.cdp.net

• CDP recommends that you consult your legal or accounting advisor when
determining your consolidation approach.
• This question is asking you to provide details on your consolidation approach
only. You will be able to indicate exclusions to your environmental performance
data from the boundary determined by this approach later in the relevant
environmental performance module for each relevant environmental issue.
• In line with the Science-Based Targets Network (SBTN), organizations should
use the same consolidation approach across environmental issues and use the
financial or operational control approach when setting science-based targets for
nature. Refer to the SBTN Technical Guidance Step 1 Assess for more details.
• Organizations who have used the GHG Protocol for emissions accounting are
strongly recommended by SBTN to use the same consolidation approach for
setting science-based targets for nature. For example, if your organization uses
the financial control approach for consolidating GHG emissions, then you should
use the same approach to consolidate other environmental data.
Consolidation approach used (column 1)
• Select the consolidation approach that best reflects the approach used to
attribute environmental impacts to your organization.
• In row “Climate change”, select the consolidation approach used to consolidate
your GHG inventory. To support the use, tracking, and comparability of reported
GHG information, respondents are encouraged to adopt the consolidation
approaches based on the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, outlined in more
detail in Chapter 3 of the Standard.
• If you have previously disclosed data to CDP and your consolidation approach
has changed in the reporting year, select your new approach in the relevant row.
If your consolidation approach in row “Climate change” has changed in the
reporting year, you should also provide details of the change in 7.1.2.
• The drop-down options are based on the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, and
are described in more detail below (text adapted from the GHG Protocol
Corporate Standard)
o Financial control: An organization has financial control over an
operation if it has the ability to direct the financial and operating policies of
the operation with a view to gaining economic benefits from its activities.
Generally, an organization has financial control over an operation for
GHG accounting purposes if the operation is treated as a group company
or subsidiary for the purposes of financial consolidation.
o Operational control: An organization has operational control over an
operation if it or one of its subsidiaries has the full authority to introduce
and implement its operating policies at the operation.
o Equity share: Under the equity share approach, an organization
accounts for GHG emissions from operations according to its share of
equity in the operation. The equity share reflects the economic interest,
which is the extent of rights an organization has to the risks and rewards
flowing from an operation. Typically, the share of economic risks and
rewards in an operation is aligned with the organization’s percentage
ownership of that operation, and equity share will normally be the same
as the ownership percentage. Where this is not the case, the economic
substance of the relationship the company has with the operation always
overrides the legal ownership form to ensure the equity share reflects the
percentage of economic interest. The principle of economic substance
taking precedence over legal form is consistent with international financial
reporting standards.

o Other, please specify: Select this option if none of the other options
apply. If you select this option, provide a label in the text field provided.
• In the case of leasing arrangements, see the GHG Protocol Appendix:
Categorizing GHG Emissions from Leased Assets and the lease accounting
standard from your relevant generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to
determine the appropriate scope for those emissions.
Provide the rationale for the choice of consolidation approach (column 2)
• For example, if you have used the same consolidation approach for reporting
water and forests-related data due to alignment with SBTN guidance, then state
this here.
• If you have used the same consolidation approach as used in your financial
accounting, then state this here.
• If you have used a different consolidation approach for consolidating different
types of environmental data, explain the rationale for this difference. For
example, if you use a different consolidation approach for GHG emissions
accounting and for water accounting, explain why.
